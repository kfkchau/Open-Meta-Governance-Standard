# Open Meta-Governance Standard — Draft

**Purpose.** This repository is the **front door for naming alignment** and discovery. It points to the **canonical lifecycle spec** and notes how it relates to the broader ecosystem.

- **Canonical lifecycle spec:** **Universal Governance Lifecycle Standard (UGLS)** — *lifecycle “kernel” for rule governance.*  
- **Source of truth:** lives in the UGLS repository (see link below).

> **Meta‑governance** = governance of **rule governance** itself. OMGS‑Draft is a light umbrella entry-point; it does **not** replace or rename UGLS.

## Where to find the lifecycle (UGLS)

- **UGLS repository (canonical):** https://github.com/kfkchau/gov-lifecycle/

This umbrella repo keeps the **name alignment** public and routes discussions to the right place. Edit proposals for lifecycle text should be opened in the UGLS repository.

---

## How this relates to OGS and CGL (for orientation only)

- **OGS — Open Governance Standard (umbrella):** the broader effort that organises language, lifecycle, tasks, and orchestration.  
- **CGL — Common Governance Language:** the shared grammar for expressing rule logic (separate project).

> OMGS‑Draft is only a **front door**. It aligns names and points to UGLS; OGS and CGL may live in separate repositories.

- **This repo contains no normative spec text** beyond names/pointers; the lifecycle spec remains in UGLS.
