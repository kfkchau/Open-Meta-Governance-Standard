# Accountability Framework

---

## 1. Introduction: Structural Accountability

### 1.1 The Failure of Aspirational Accountability

Traditional governance relies on aspirational accountability: expecting people to "be ethical," "act responsibly," or "serve the public interest." These are values, not mechanisms. They fail because:

**No Verification Mechanism:**
Cannot check if someone is "being ethical" - too vague, too subjective, depends on individual interpretation.

**No Structural Enforcement:**
Relies on individual virtue, conscience, or fear of reputation damage. When individuals lack virtue or don't fear consequences, system fails.

**No Scalability:**
Works in small groups where personal relationships create accountability. Fails in large systems where anonymity and distance enable irresponsibility.

**Examples of Aspirational Failure:**
- "Decision Makers should make good decisions" - but what's "good"? Who checks? What happens if they don't?
- "Rule Makers should consult stakeholders" - but what if they don't? Who can verify? What's the consequence?
- "Everyone should follow rules" - but why? What if rules are illegitimate? How is compliance verified?

Aspirational accountability creates governance theater: appearance of responsibility without actual mechanism ensuring it.

### 1.2 How Structural Accountability Works

Structural accountability replaces aspirations with architecture. Instead of hoping people behave well, create structure that makes irresponsibility:
- **Detectable** (violations are observable)
- **Verifiable** (others can check)
- **Consequential** (violations trigger responses)

The mechanism: **Rights and obligations that correspond across roles.**

**How it creates accountability:**

**Self-Policing Through Anticipated Checking:**
Knowing my obligations will be checked (others have rights to verify) creates incentive to comply before checking occurs. Not constant surveillance - psychological weight of anticipated accountability.

**Distributed Verification:**
Don't need omniscient overseer. Each role can check some other roles through their rights. Accountability distributed throughout system, not centralized.

**Observable Requirements:**
Rights and obligations specified as observable actions or evidence trails. Can verify compliance/violation through checking, not through mind-reading or subjective judgment.

**Structural, Not Personal:**
System works regardless of individual virtue. Good people AND bad people subject to same checking mechanisms. Doesn't depend on ethics - depends on architecture.

### 1.3 Rights and Obligations as Accountability Mechanism

Rights and obligations are paired concepts creating mutual accountability:

**Right:** 
Entitlement or claim one role has, creating corresponding duty in another role. Enables verification - right-holder can check if duty fulfilled.

**Obligation:**
Duty or requirement one role has, created by another role's rights. Creates checkable behavior - others can verify compliance.

**The Correspondence:**
Your right creates my obligation. My obligation enables your checking. This creates accountability chain: you can hold me accountable through your rights, I can hold others accountable through my rights.

**Why This Works:**
- Rights enable checking (you can verify I fulfilled obligation)
- Obligations create checkable behaviors (I must do observable things)
- Correspondence ensures mutual accountability (everyone both checks and is checked)
- Structure persists regardless of individuals (rights/obligations are architectural, not personal)

This accountability framework is foundation for legitimate governance. Without it, governance is either:
- Aspirational theater (hope for responsibility, no mechanism)
- Pure coercion (force compliance without legitimacy)

With it, governance becomes:
- Legitimate (accountability to those governed)
- Verifiable (can check compliance)
- Structural (doesn't depend on virtue)
- Scalable (works in large systems)

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 What is a Right?

A **right** is an entitlement or claim that one role has, creating corresponding duty in another role (or expectation from a resource/system).

**Key characteristics:**

**Enables Action or Verification:**
Rights empower the right-holder to do something (obtain, access, participate) or verify something (check that obligations fulfilled).

**Creates Corresponding Duty:**
When Role A has a right, it typically creates an obligation in Role B to fulfill that right (though not always - see interaction patterns).

**Must Be Checkable:**
Rights must be verifiable. Can assess whether right was honored or violated through observable evidence.

**Has Direction:**
Rights specify direction of value flow: right to GET (extract), RECEIVE (accept), GIVE (transfer), or BE TAKEN FROM (submit to extraction).

**Has Discretion Level:**
Rights can be mandatory (MUST - cannot decline) or optional (SHOULD - can decline with justification).

**Examples:**

"Rule User has RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE announcement before rule effectiveness"
- Entitlement: Will receive announcement
- Mandatory: Cannot opt out
- Creates obligation: Someone must deliver announcement
- Checkable: Did announcement occur before effectiveness? (observable)

"Public has RIGHT to SHOULD GET flyers from available stack"
- Entitlement: Can take flyer
- Optional: Can decline (don't have to take)
- Creates obligation: Flyer holder must make available
- Checkable: Are flyers accessible? (observable)

### 2.2 What is an Obligation?

An **obligation** is a duty or requirement that one role has, often created by another role's rights (or required by interaction with resource/system).

**Key characteristics:**

**Requires Action or Submission:**
Obligations compel the obligation-holder to do something (provide, transfer, complete) or allow something (permit extraction, allow access).

**Created By Rights:**
When Role A has a right, it typically creates an obligation in Role B (though not always - obligations can exist independently).

**Must Be Checkable:**
Obligations must be verifiable. Can assess compliance or violation through observable actions or evidence.

**Has Direction:**
Obligations specify direction of value flow: obligation to GIVE (provide), RECEIVE (accept), GET (obtain), or BE TAKEN FROM (allow extraction).

**Has Discretion Level:**
Obligations can be mandatory (MUST - no excuse for non-compliance) or rebuttable (SHOULD - deviation requires justification).

**Examples:**

"Government has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE child support to eligible families"
- Duty: Must provide funding
- Mandatory: No excuse for non-provision
- Created by: Family's right to receive
- Checkable: Did families receive funding? (observable)

"Foreign worker has OBLIGATION to MUST GET visa before working"
- Duty: Must obtain visa
- Mandatory: Cannot work without it
- May create: Government obligation to provide visa service
- Checkable: Does worker have valid visa? (observable)

### 2.3 The Correspondence Principle

Rights and obligations correspond across roles, creating accountability relationships.

**Basic Correspondence:**
When Role A has a right, it often creates an obligation in Role B to fulfill that right. When Role B has an obligation, Role A often has a right to verify fulfillment.

**But correspondence is flexible, not rigid:**

**Right-Obligation Pairs (Traditional Accountability):**
- Family has RIGHT to RECEIVE child support
- Government has OBLIGATION to GIVE child support
- Asymmetric: one protected, one constrained

**Right-Right Pairs (Mutual Benefit):**
- Person A has RIGHT to GET public resource
- Person B has RIGHT to GET same resource
- Symmetric: both benefit, cooperation, commons

**Obligation-Obligation Pairs (Mutual Constraint):**
- Worker has OBLIGATION to GET visa
- Government has OBLIGATION to PROVIDE visa service
- Symmetric: both constrained, mutual burden

**No Pairing (Role-Resource):**
- Worker has OBLIGATION to complete training
- Training is resource, not role with rights
- Asymmetric: only role side specified

**Why Flexible Correspondence Matters:**

Governance relationships take many forms:
- Protection (right holder protected from obligation holder)
- Cooperation (both parties benefit through shared rights)
- Regulation (both parties constrained through obligations)
- Development (individual obligation to engage with resources)

Rigid correspondence (every right creates obligation) would force all relationships into one pattern, failing to model reality's diversity.

Flexible correspondence enables modeling any accountability relationship through appropriate right/obligation combinations.

## 3. Three-Dimensional Specification

Every right or obligation is fully specified by three independent dimensions. Understanding these dimensions enables precise accountability specification.

### 3.1 Dimension 1: Type (Right or Obligation)

**RIGHT:**
Entitlement, claim, or empowerment that enables the right-holder to obtain, access, participate, or verify.

**OBLIGATION:**
Duty, requirement, or constraint that compels the obligation-holder to provide, complete, allow, or refrain.

**Why this distinction matters:**
- Rights empower and protect
- Obligations constrain and require
- Same person can have both (rights in some relationships, obligations in others)
- Type determines who can verify: right-holders verify obligations fulfilled, obligation-holders cannot verify their own obligations (conflict of interest)

### 3.2 Dimension 2: Direction (Flow of Value)

Direction specifies how value flows in the accountability relationship.

**Value** is broadly defined: time, effort, attention, money, resources, access, information, authority, or anything exchangeable or of worth.

**Four directions:**

**TO GIVE:** 
Actively provide or transfer value to another. The giver initiates provision or responds to request.

**TO RECEIVE:**
Passively accept value from another. The receiver accepts what's provided or delivered.

**TO GET:**
Actively extract, access, or obtain value from another. The getter initiates acquisition.

**TO BE TAKEN FROM:**
Passively allow value to be extracted or accessed. The submitter makes available or permits extraction.

**Why direction matters:**
- Specifies who initiates (giver/getter vs receiver/submitter)
- Determines evidence type (delivery confirmation vs access log)
- Affects verification mechanism (check provision vs check extraction)
- Models different relationship dynamics (active provision vs passive availability)

### 3.3 Dimension 3: Discretion (Must or Should)

Discretion specifies whether the right or obligation is mandatory or rebuttable.

**MUST (Mandatory):**
No discretion to decline, deviate, or excuse. Compliance required regardless of preferences or circumstances.

**SHOULD (Rebuttable):**
Limited discretion to decline or deviate with justification. Strong expectation, but can be rebutted with good reason.

**Why discretion matters:**
- Determines rigidity (absolute vs flexible)
- Affects violation definition (failure vs unjustified failure)
- Enables context-appropriate specification (some obligations absolute, others contextual)
- Applies to BOTH rights and obligations (not just obligations)

**Discretion in Rights:**

**RIGHT to MUST:** "You WILL receive X whether you want it or not"
- Cannot opt out
- Forced benefit (paternalistic)
- Example: "Worker has RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE safety briefing" - required to accept, cannot decline

**RIGHT to SHOULD:** "You are guaranteed X, but you CAN decline"
- Can opt out
- Optional benefit
- Example: "Worker has RIGHT to SHOULD RECEIVE retirement consultation" - offered, but can decline

**Discretion in Obligations:**

**OBLIGATION to MUST:** "You WILL do X, no excuse accepted"
- Absolute requirement
- Violation if not performed
- Example: "Government has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE child support" - no excuse for non-provision

**OBLIGATION to SHOULD:** "You SHOULD do X, unless good reason"
- Rebuttable expectation
- Violation only if no justification
- Example: "Employer has OBLIGATION to SHOULD GIVE advance notice" - expected, but emergencies excuse

### 3.4 The Specification Format

Every right or obligation specified as:

**TYPE / DIRECTION / DISCRETION + Object/Value**

Examples:

"RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE announcement"
- Type: RIGHT
- Direction: RECEIVE (passive acceptance)
- Discretion: MUST (cannot decline)
- Object: announcement

"OBLIGATION to SHOULD GIVE advance notice"
- Type: OBLIGATION
- Direction: GIVE (active provision)
- Discretion: SHOULD (rebuttable)
- Object: advance notice

"RIGHT to SHOULD GET public records"
- Type: RIGHT
- Direction: GET (active extraction)
- Discretion: SHOULD (optional - can choose not to request)
- Object: public records

"OBLIGATION to MUST BE TAKEN FROM for inspection"
- Type: OBLIGATION
- Direction: BE TAKEN FROM (allow extraction)
- Discretion: MUST (cannot refuse)
- Object: inspection access

This format enables precise, checkable specification of any accountability relationship.

## 4. Direction Types Explained

### 4.1 TO GIVE (Active Provision)

**Definition:**
Actively provide or transfer value to another party. The giver initiates the transaction or responds to request.

**Characteristics:**
- **Active:** Giver takes action to deliver
- **Outflow:** Value leaves giver, goes to recipient
- **Pairs with:** TO RECEIVE (recipient accepts what's given)

**Examples:**

"Government has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE child support to eligible families"
- Active: Government initiates payment
- Outflow: Funds leave government, go to families
- Pairs with: Family has RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE child support

"Employer has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE free safety training materials to new workers"
- Active: Employer provides materials
- Outflow: Materials leave employer, go to worker
- Pairs with: Worker has RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE free safety training materials

"Worker has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE time for mandatory training"
- Active: Worker allocates time
- Outflow: Time given to training activity
- Pairs with: Employer has RIGHT to GET trained worker (outcome)

**Evidence of GIVE:**
- Delivery confirmation
- Transfer records
- Receipt signatures
- Transaction logs
- Witness testimony

### 4.2 TO RECEIVE (Passive Reception)

**Definition:**
Passively accept value from another party. The receiver accepts what's delivered or provided.

**Characteristics:**
- **Passive:** Receiver accepts, doesn't initiate
- **Inflow:** Value comes to receiver
- **Pairs with:** TO GIVE (someone provides what's received)

**Examples:**

"Family has RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE child support from government"
- Passive: Family accepts payment
- Inflow: Funds come to family
- Pairs with: Government has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE child support

"Worker has RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE free safety training materials"
- Passive: Worker accepts materials
- Inflow: Materials come to worker
- Pairs with: Employer has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE free safety training materials
- Note: "At least we need to see that you have received it, but if you throw it away that's not on us" - obligation is to receive (take delivery), not to use

"Worker has OBLIGATION to MUST RECEIVE safety briefing"
- Passive: Worker accepts briefing
- Inflow: Information comes to worker
- Mandatory: Cannot decline (MUST)
- Pairs with: Employer has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE briefing

**Evidence of RECEIVE:**
- Receipt confirmation
- Acceptance signature
- Delivery records showing receipt
- Confirmation of access to delivered item

**Important distinction:**
RECEIVE is about accepting delivery, not about using or benefiting from what's received. Once received, what happens to the object is separate question.

### 4.3 TO GET (Active Extraction)

**Definition:**
Actively extract, access, or obtain value from another party. The getter initiates the transaction.

**Characteristics:**
- **Active:** Getter takes action to obtain
- **Inflow:** Value comes to getter (extracted from source)
- **Pairs with:** TO BE TAKEN FROM (source allows extraction)

**Examples:**

"Foreign worker has OBLIGATION to MUST GET visa before working"
- Active: Worker initiates visa application
- Inflow: Visa (credential) obtained by worker
- Pairs with: Government has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE visa service (or MUST BE TAKEN FROM - allow visa to be obtained)

"Public has RIGHT to SHOULD GET flyers from available stack"
- Active: Public initiates taking flyer
- Inflow: Flyer obtained by public
- Optional: Can choose not to take (SHOULD)
- Pairs with: Flyer holder has OBLIGATION to BE TAKEN FROM (make available)

"Auditor has RIGHT to MUST GET financial records from company"
- Active: Auditor requests/accesses records
- Inflow: Records obtained by auditor
- Mandatory: Company cannot prevent (auditor has MUST right)
- Pairs with: Company has OBLIGATION to BE TAKEN FROM (allow access)

**Evidence of GET:**
- Application records
- Access logs
- Extraction records
- Obtained credentials/documents
- Timestamps of acquisition

### 4.4 TO BE TAKEN FROM (Passive Submission)

**Definition:**
Passively allow value to be extracted or accessed by another party. The submitter makes available or permits extraction.

**Characteristics:**
- **Passive:** Submitter doesn't initiate, allows extraction
- **Outflow:** Value leaves submitter (accessed by getter)
- **Pairs with:** TO GET (someone extracts what's made available)

**Examples:**

"Flyer holder has OBLIGATION to SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM (make flyers available)"
- Passive: Holder places flyers, allows taking
- Outflow: Flyers leave holder's control
- Optional: Context-dependent (SHOULD)
- Pairs with: Public has RIGHT to SHOULD GET flyers

"Company has OBLIGATION to MUST BE TAKEN FROM (allow inspection)"
- Passive: Company permits access
- Outflow: Information/access extracted by inspector
- Mandatory: Cannot refuse (MUST)
- Pairs with: Inspector has RIGHT to MUST GET inspection access

"Government has OBLIGATION to MUST BE TAKEN FROM (visa service available)"
- Passive: Government makes visa service accessible
- Outflow: Visa credentials obtained by applicants
- Mandatory: Must provide service (MUST)
- Pairs with: Worker has OBLIGATION to MUST GET visa

**Evidence of BE TAKEN FROM:**
- Availability records (was resource accessible?)
- Access logs (who accessed when?)
- Submission confirmations
- Non-interference records (no blocking occurred)

**Important distinction:**
BE TAKEN FROM describes passive availability vs GIVE describes active provision.
- GIVE: "I deliver child support to you" (active, targeted delivery)
- BE TAKEN FROM: "I make flyers available, you take if you want" (passive, open availability)

## 5. Discretion Levels

### 5.1 MUST (Mandatory)

**Definition:**
Mandatory requirement or entitlement with no discretion to decline, deviate, or excuse.

**For Obligations:**
- Must perform, no acceptable excuse
- Failure = violation regardless of circumstances
- Compliance required even if burdensome or inconvenient

**For Rights:**
- Must accept/receive, cannot opt out
- Entitlement is forced (paternalistic)
- Benefit cannot be declined

**Examples:**

**OBLIGATION to MUST:**
"Government has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE child support"
- Must provide, no excuse accepted
- Budget shortfall not valid excuse
- Administrative burden not valid excuse
- Failure = violation

**RIGHT to MUST:**
"Worker has RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE safety briefing"
- Must accept briefing, cannot decline
- "I already know safety procedures" not valid opt-out
- "I'm too busy" not valid opt-out
- Paternalistic: forced for worker's benefit

**Why MUST is used:**
- Critical obligations (child welfare, safety, rights protection)
- Non-negotiable requirements (legal compliance, safety minimums)
- Paternalistic protection (forced benefits for own good)
- Structural necessity (system requires this to function)

### 5.2 SHOULD (Rebuttable)

**Definition:**
Strong expectation or entitlement with limited discretion to decline or deviate, requiring justification.

**For Obligations:**
- Should perform, but deviation permitted with good reason
- Failure without justification = violation
- Failure with justification = acceptable
- Burden on obligation-holder to provide justification

**For Rights:**
- Should be offered/available, but can be declined
- Entitlement is optional (empowering)
- Benefit can be refused without justification

**Examples:**

**OBLIGATION to SHOULD:**
"Employer has OBLIGATION to SHOULD GIVE advance notice of schedule changes"
- Should provide notice, but emergencies excuse
- No notice + no emergency = violation
- No notice + emergency = acceptable
- Context matters, justification required

**RIGHT to SHOULD:**
"Worker has RIGHT to SHOULD RECEIVE retirement planning consultation"
- Guaranteed to be offered
- Can decline without justification
- "I'm not interested" is sufficient opt-out
- Empowering: choice preserved

**Why SHOULD is used:**
- Context-dependent obligations (emergencies happen)
- Rebuttable expectations (normally required, but exceptions exist)
- Optional benefits (available but not forced)
- Guidance vs mandate (strong recommendation, not absolute requirement)

### 5.3 Why Only Two Levels

Earlier draft included MAY and COULD as additional discretion levels. These are NOT discretion levels because they describe permissions or options, not obligations.

**MAY and COULD are:**
- Permissions (describing what's allowed)
- Options (describing what's possible)
- Informational (explaining choices available)

**They belong in:**
- Rule justification (explaining design choices)
- Communication materials (guiding Rule Users)
- NOT in rights/obligations specification

**Why confusion occurs:**
Traditional legal language uses MAY for permissions: "You MAY file an appeal" means you have the option (not required). This is permission, not obligation level.

**Clarity through two levels:**
- Obligations either ARE (MUST/SHOULD) or AREN'T (no obligation = permission)
- Rights either FORCED (MUST) or OPTIONAL (SHOULD)
- Clean distinction: mandatory vs rebuttable, no middle ground of "sort of required"

### 5.4 Context-Dependent Consequences

Discretion levels (MUST/SHOULD) are universal - they work across all governance contexts. However, consequences of violating MUST or SHOULD vary by context.

**Criminal Law:**
- MUST violation: Criminal offense (jail, fines, criminal record)
- SHOULD violation: Lesser offense or civil penalty

**Administrative Law:**
- MUST violation: Penalty, sanction, license revocation
- SHOULD violation: Warning, corrective action required

**Corporate Policy:**
- MUST violation: Disciplinary action (termination, suspension)
- SHOULD violation: Performance review, training required

**Platform Rules:**
- MUST violation: Account suspension, permanent ban
- SHOULD violation: Warning, temporary restriction

**Family Rules:**
- MUST violation: Loss of privileges, consequences
- SHOULD violation: Discussion, guidance

**Why this matters:**
- Framework specifies MUST vs SHOULD (universal)
- Context determines what violation means (contextual)
- Same discretion level, different consequences depending on governance context
- But accountability logic holds across contexts: MUST = no excuse, SHOULD = justification required

**Framework requirement:**
When specifying rights/obligations, clearly indicate discretion level (MUST or SHOULD). Context will determine consequences, but discretion level determines whether violations occurred.

## 6. Interaction Patterns

Accountability relationships take different forms depending on whether both parties are roles with agency (Role-Role) or one party is a resource/system (Role-Resource).

### 6.1 Role-Role Interactions

**Definition:**
Both parties are actors with agency, both capable of having rights and obligations.

**Characteristics:**
- Both sides can have rights/obligations specified
- Accountability flows both directions (mutual checking possible)
- Discretion levels apply to both sides
- Pairing creates accountability relationships

**Examples:**

**Employer-Worker:**
- Both are roles with agency
- Employer has obligations (give pay, provide safe environment)
- Worker has obligations (give work, follow rules)
- Employer has rights (get work product, get compliance)
- Worker has rights (receive pay, receive safe environment)
- Mutual accountability through paired rights/obligations

**Government-Citizen:**
- Both are roles with agency
- Government has obligations (provide services, protect rights)
- Citizen has obligations (pay taxes, obey laws)
- Government has rights (receive taxes, maintain order)
- Citizen has rights (receive services, challenge government)
- Mutual accountability through paired rights/obligations

**Manager-Report:**
- Both are roles with agency
- Manager has obligations (provide guidance, conduct reviews)
- Report has obligations (complete assigned work, provide updates)
- Manager has rights (receive work product, receive status updates)
- Report has rights (receive guidance, receive fair evaluation)
- Mutual accountability through paired rights/obligations

### 6.2 Role-Resource Interactions

**Definition:**
One party is actor with agency (role), other party is resource, system, or process without agency.

**Characteristics:**
- Only role side has rights/obligations specified
- Resource side has no discretion (it's a thing, not actor)
- No mutual accountability (resource can't check role)
- Accountability flows one direction only

**Examples:**

**Worker-Training:**
- Worker is role with agency
- Training is resource/process (course, materials, system)
- Worker has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE time for training
- Training doesn't have obligations (it's not an actor)
- No pairing on training side

**Applicant-Certification:**
- Applicant is role with agency
- Certification is credential/system
- Applicant has OBLIGATION to MUST GET certification
- Certification system doesn't have obligations in same way (it's process, not actor)
- System has rules/requirements, but these aren't role obligations

**User-Data System:**
- User is role with agency
- Data system is resource/infrastructure
- User may have OBLIGATION to SHOULD RECEIVE system updates
- System doesn't have obligations as role (it operates according to design, not agency)

**Why this distinction matters:**

In Role-Role interactions:
- Specify both sides (both have rights/obligations)
- Both sides generate evidence
- Mutual checking possible

In Role-Resource interactions:
- Specify only role side
- Only role generates evidence of compliance
- No mutual checking (resource can't verify role behavior)

**Outcome as implicit "obligation":**
In Role-Resource interactions, the resource/system may have implicit "obligation" to function correctly:
- Training must actually educate (if it doesn't, it fails its purpose)
- Certification must actually validate competency (if it doesn't, it's broken)
- But these are design requirements, not role obligations

This distinction prevents anthropomorphizing resources while maintaining clear accountability for roles interacting with resources.

### 6.3 Pairing Scenarios in Role-Role Interactions

When both parties are roles, various pairing scenarios are possible:

**Traditional Pairing (Right-Obligation):**
One role has right, other has obligation. Asymmetric power, protection-based.

**Mutual Benefit (Right-Right):**
Both roles have rights. Symmetric benefit, cooperation-based.

**Mutual Constraint (Obligation-Obligation):**
Both roles have obligations. Symmetric burden, regulation-based.

**Asymmetric Discretion:**
Different MUST/SHOULD levels across pair. Context-dependent flexibility.

**No Rigid Requirement:**
Framework doesn't mandate specific pairing type. Governance designers choose pairing based on relationship they want to create.

This flexibility enables modeling real governance relationships, which don't fit rigid templates.

---

## 7. Pairing Scenario Types

### 7.1 Traditional Accountability (Right-Obligation Pair)

**Structure:**
- Role A has RIGHT (empowered, protected)
- Role B has OBLIGATION (constrained, dutiful)
- Asymmetric relationship

**Purpose:**
Protect weaker party, ensure service delivery, create accountability from powerful to less-powerful.

**When used:**
- Government providing services to citizens
- Employer providing benefits to workers
- Care providers serving vulnerable populations
- Any relationship where one party needs protection

**Examples:**

"Family has RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE child support"
- Family: empowered, protected
- Ensures family receives necessary support

"Government has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE child support"
- Government: constrained, dutiful
- Ensures government delivers on obligation

Together: Traditional accountability pair protecting vulnerable (families with children).

---

"Worker has RIGHT to SHOULD RECEIVE retirement consultation"
- Worker: empowered, optional benefit
- Ensures consultation available if wanted

"Employer has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE retirement consultation availability"
- Employer: constrained, must offer
- Must make consultation available even if worker declines

Together: Asymmetric discretion (worker can decline, employer must offer).

### 7.2 Mutual Benefit (Right-Right Pair)

**Structure:**
- Role A has RIGHT
- Role B has RIGHT
- Symmetric relationship

**Purpose:**
Enable cooperation, create shared access, establish commons, ensure mutual benefit.

**When used:**
- Public resources (everyone has right to access)
- Shared facilities (all members have right to use)
- Information commons (all have right to knowledge)
- Cooperative endeavors (both parties benefit)

**Examples:**

"Person A has RIGHT to SHOULD GET books from public library"
- Person A: can access library resources
- Optional: can choose to use or not

"Person B has RIGHT to SHOULD GET books from same library"
- Person B: can also access library resources
- Optional: can choose to use or not

Together: Both benefit from shared resource, cooperation not competition.

---

"Researcher A has RIGHT to MUST GET access to open data"
- Researcher A: entitled to access
- Mandatory: data must be accessible (can't be blocked)

"Researcher B has RIGHT to MUST GET access to same data"
- Researcher B: entitled to access
- Mandatory: data must be accessible

Together: Information commons, both researchers benefit from openness.

**Why Right-Right Works:**
Creates positive-sum relationships. Both parties gain, neither loses. Enables cooperation and shared benefit without zero-sum competition.

### 7.3 Mutual Constraint (Obligation-Obligation Pair)

**Structure:**
- Role A has OBLIGATION
- Role B has OBLIGATION
- Symmetric relationship

**Purpose:**
Ensure regulatory compliance, create mutual burden for public good, establish reciprocal duties.

**When used:**
- Regulatory compliance (both parties must comply)
- Reciprocal agreements (both parties must deliver)
- Public health mandates (both parties must participate)
- Mutual accountability in transactions

**Examples:**

"Foreign worker has OBLIGATION to MUST GET visa before working"
- Worker: constrained, must obtain visa
- Cannot work without compliance

"Government has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE visa service to eligible applicants"
- Government: constrained, must provide service
- Cannot refuse eligible applicants

Together: Both constrained. Worker must comply with immigration law, government must provide immigration service. Mutual burden.

---

"Buyer has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE payment"
- Buyer: constrained, must pay
- Cannot receive goods without payment

"Seller has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE goods"
- Seller: constrained, must deliver
- Cannot keep goods after receiving payment

Together: Reciprocal obligations creating fair exchange.

**Why Obligation-Obligation Works:**
Creates negative-sum appearance (both constrained) but actually enables positive outcome (fair transaction, regulatory compliance, public good). Both parties bear burden to achieve mutual or societal benefit.

### 7.4 Asymmetric Discretion

**Structure:**
- Role A has MUST (mandatory)
- Role B has SHOULD (rebuttable)
- Or Role A has RIGHT/OBLIGATION while Role B has OBLIGATION/RIGHT
- Asymmetric discretion across pair

**Purpose:**
Create flexibility where needed, maintain rigidity where critical, balance competing concerns.

**When used:**
- One party needs absolute compliance (safety, rights protection)
- Other party needs contextual flexibility (operational constraints)
- Power imbalances require different constraint levels

**Examples:**

"Worker has RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE free safety training materials"
- Worker: mandatory reception (cannot decline)
- Paternalistic: forced for own good

"Employer has OBLIGATION to SHOULD GIVE materials"
- Employer: rebuttable obligation (normally required)
- Can justify deviation (e.g., temporary supply shortage)

Together: Worker cannot decline (protection), but employer has limited flexibility in delivery timing/method.

---

"Government has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE emergency services"
- Government: absolute obligation (no excuse)
- Critical services cannot be denied

"Citizen has RIGHT to SHOULD GET emergency services"
- Citizen: optional (can decline services if competent to decide)
- Medical autonomy: can refuse treatment

Together: Government must offer (no discretion), citizen can decline (has discretion).

**Why Asymmetric Discretion Works:**
Real governance relationships often require different constraint levels. Framework doesn't force symmetry when asymmetry better models relationship.

### 7.5 No Pairing Required (Role-Resource)

**Structure:**
- Role has RIGHT or OBLIGATION
- Resource has no specified right/obligation (it's not an actor)
- No pairing on resource side

**Purpose:**
Model role-resource interactions without anthropomorphizing resources.

**When used:**
- Role interacting with system, process, infrastructure
- Role interacting with credential, certification, standard
- Role undergoing development, transformation, education

**Examples:**

"Worker has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE time for safety training"
- Worker: constrained, must participate
- Training: resource/process, not actor

No pairing: Training doesn't have obligations as role. Training has design requirements (must actually educate) but these aren't role obligations.

---

"Applicant has OBLIGATION to MUST GET professional certification"
- Applicant: constrained, must obtain credential
- Certification: system/standard, not actor

No pairing: Certification system has rules/requirements, but these are system design, not role obligations.

---

"Student has RIGHT to SHOULD RECEIVE educational resources"
- Student: entitled, optional (can choose not to use)
- Educational resources: materials/system, not actor

No pairing: Resources don't have obligations. Providing institution has obligation to make resources available, but resources themselves are not actors.

**Why No Pairing Works:**
Not everything is an accountability relationship between two roles. Sometimes roles interact with systems, processes, standards, or resources. Framework models these without forcing artificial pairing.

## 8. The Complete Matrix

### 8.1 Matrix Dimensions

The three dimensions create a specification space:

**TYPE (2 options):**
- RIGHT
- OBLIGATION

**DIRECTION (4 options):**
- TO GIVE
- TO RECEIVE
- TO GET
- TO BE TAKEN FROM

**DISCRETION (2 options):**
- MUST
- SHOULD

**Total combinations: 2 × 4 × 2 = 16 possible specifications**

All 16 combinations are potentially valid, depending on context and interaction type.

### 8.2 Matrix Applications by Combination

Not all combinations are equally common. Some are rare but still valid in specific contexts.

**Common Combinations:**
- RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE (forced benefits: safety briefings, announcements)
- OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE (service delivery: child support, wages)
- RIGHT to SHOULD GET (optional access: public resources, information)
- OBLIGATION to MUST GET (regulatory compliance: licenses, certifications)
- OBLIGATION to MUST BE TAKEN FROM (mandatory submission: inspections, audits)

**Less Common But Valid:**
- RIGHT to MUST GIVE (forced transfer: testifying under subpoena)
- OBLIGATION to SHOULD RECEIVE (rebuttable reception: feedback, advice)
- RIGHT to SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM (optional extraction: voluntary monitoring)

**Rare But Potentially Valid:**
- RIGHT to SHOULD GIVE (optional provision: charitable giving as right)
- OBLIGATION to SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM (rebuttable submission: voluntary disclosure)

Framework doesn't prohibit any combination. Governance designers choose appropriate combination for their context.

### 8.3 Examples Across Combinations

**Matrix organized by TYPE and DIRECTION, showing both MUST and SHOULD variants:**

#### RIGHT Combinations:

**RIGHT / TO GIVE:**
- MUST: "Witness has RIGHT to MUST GIVE testimony when subpoenaed" (cannot refuse)
- SHOULD: "Citizen has RIGHT to SHOULD GIVE feedback on proposed rule" (can decline)

**RIGHT / TO RECEIVE:**
- MUST: "Worker has RIGHT to MUST RECEIVE safety briefing" (cannot decline)
- SHOULD: "Manager has RIGHT to SHOULD RECEIVE performance feedback" (can decline)

**RIGHT / TO GET:**
- MUST: "Inspector has RIGHT to MUST GET access to records" (cannot be denied)
- SHOULD: "Public has RIGHT to SHOULD GET flyers from stack" (can choose not to take)

**RIGHT / TO BE TAKEN FROM:**
- MUST: "Witness has RIGHT to MUST BE TAKEN FROM for testimony" (forced to testify - rare phrasing but valid)
- SHOULD: "Participant has RIGHT to SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM for research" (can opt in to study)

#### OBLIGATION Combinations:

**OBLIGATION / TO GIVE:**
- MUST: "Government has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE child support" (no excuse)
- SHOULD: "Employer has OBLIGATION to SHOULD GIVE advance notice" (rebuttable)

**OBLIGATION / TO RECEIVE:**
- MUST: "Worker has OBLIGATION to MUST RECEIVE safety briefing" (forced reception)
- SHOULD: "Manager has OBLIGATION to SHOULD RECEIVE feedback" (expected but can decline with reason)

**OBLIGATION / TO GET:**
- MUST: "Foreign worker has OBLIGATION to MUST GET visa" (cannot work without)
- SHOULD: "Professional has OBLIGATION to SHOULD GET continuing education" (rebuttable requirement)

**OBLIGATION / TO BE TAKEN FROM:**
- MUST: "Company has OBLIGATION to MUST BE TAKEN FROM for inspection" (cannot refuse)
- SHOULD: "Organization has OBLIGATION to SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM for voluntary audit" (expected but can decline with justification)

**Usage notes:**
- MUST combinations enforce absolute requirements/entitlements
- SHOULD combinations provide flexibility while maintaining expectations
- Direction determines who initiates (active: GIVE/GET, passive: RECEIVE/BE TAKEN FROM)
- Type determines who can verify (rights enable checking of corresponding obligations)

## 9. Checkability and Evidence

Rights and obligations must be checkable through observable actions or evidence. Without checkability, accountability becomes aspirational rather than structural.

### 9.1 Observable Requirements

**Every right and obligation must be verifiable through:**

**Observable Actions:**
- Something happens (or doesn't happen)
- Action is detectable through observation
- Timing of action is establishable
- Actor of action is identifiable

**Evidence Trails:**
- Documents, records, logs created
- Physical artifacts produced or transferred
- System states changed
- Traces left by activities

**Witnesses:**
- Others can attest to occurrence
- Multiple observers possible
- Corroboration available

**System Records:**
- Automated logging
- Transaction records
- Access logs
- State change records

**Why checkability is critical:**
Without checkability, cannot verify compliance or violation. Without verification, no accountability - only hope and trust.

**Bad example (not checkable):**
"Worker has OBLIGATION to be responsible"
- What does "be responsible" mean operationally?
- How to observe "being responsible"?
- What evidence shows responsibility?
- Vague, subjective, unverifiable

**Good example (checkable):**
"Worker has OBLIGATION to MUST RECEIVE safety briefing before accessing hazardous area"
- Observable: Did worker attend briefing? (attendance record)
- Observable: Did briefing occur before access? (timestamp comparison)
- Evidence: Attendance record, briefing completion certificate, access log
- Clear, objective, verifiable

### 9.2 Evidence for Different Direction Types

Each direction type generates characteristic evidence:

**GIVE (Active Provision):**
- **Delivery confirmation:** Receipt signature, delivery record
- **Transfer records:** Transaction log, payment confirmation
- **Provision documentation:** What was given, when, to whom
- **Sender evidence:** Sent from sender's system/location

Example: Government gives child support
- Evidence: Transfer record from government account to family account
- Evidence: Deposit timestamp and amount
- Evidence: Government's financial records showing disbursement

**RECEIVE (Passive Reception):**
- **Receipt confirmation:** Acknowledgment of receiving
- **Acceptance signature:** Physical or electronic signature
- **Possession evidence:** Recipient now has the object/value
- **Receiver evidence:** Received into receiver's system/location

Example: Worker receives free safety training materials
- Evidence: Signed receipt "I received materials on [date]"
- Evidence: Materials now in worker's possession (if checked)
- Evidence: Training system shows "materials distributed to [worker] on [date]"

Note: Evidence shows reception occurred, not that worker read or used materials. Reception obligation fulfilled when received, regardless of subsequent use.

**GET (Active Extraction):**
- **Application records:** Request submitted, process initiated
- **Extraction logs:** What was obtained, when, by whom
- **Credential obtained:** License, certification, visa issued
- **Access logs:** System accessed, data extracted

Example: Worker gets visa
- Evidence: Visa application submitted (application record)
- Evidence: Visa approved and issued (government record)
- Evidence: Worker possesses visa (physical document or electronic record)
- Evidence: Visa number in government database showing valid status

**BE TAKEN FROM (Passive Submission):**
- **Availability records:** Resource was accessible
- **Access permitted:** No blocking occurred
- **Extraction allowed:** Others successfully obtained/accessed
- **Non-interference evidence:** Did not prevent access

Example: Company allows inspection
- Evidence: Inspector accessed facility (access log, inspector's report)
- Evidence: Company provided requested records (document access log)
- Evidence: Company did not obstruct (no complaints from inspector)
- Evidence: Inspection completed (inspector's completion report)

### 9.3 Evidence for Different Discretion Levels

**MUST (Mandatory):**
Violation if action did not occur, regardless of excuse.

**Evidence of compliance:**
- Action occurred (positive evidence)
- Timing was correct (timestamp evidence)
- Completeness requirements met (quality evidence)

**Evidence of violation:**
- Action did not occur (negative evidence - absence)
- Timing was wrong (occurred after deadline)
- Completeness not met (partial fulfillment)

Example: Government MUST give child support
- Compliance: Families received payments on schedule
- Violation: Some families did not receive payments (regardless of government's excuse)

**SHOULD (Rebuttable):**
Violation if action did not occur AND no justification provided.

**Evidence of compliance:**
- Action occurred (positive evidence), OR
- Action did not occur but justification provided and adequate (documentation)

**Evidence of violation:**
- Action did not occur (negative evidence) AND
- No justification provided OR justification inadequate (absence of valid excuse)

Example: Employer SHOULD give advance notice
- Compliance: Notice given, OR emergency occurred (justification documented)
- Violation: No notice given AND no emergency (unjustified failure)

**Justification requirements for SHOULD:**
- Must be documented (not just claimed after the fact)
- Must be genuine (not fabricated excuse)
- Must be relevant (emergency is relevant excuse, laziness is not)
- Burden on obligation-holder to provide justification

### 9.4 Evidence in Role-Resource Interactions

**Role-Resource:**
Only role side generates evidence of compliance/violation.

**Role's evidence:**
- Role performed obligation (completed training, obtained certification)
- Role exercised right (used available resource)
- Timing and completeness requirements met

**Resource's "evidence":**
- System state changed (training completed in system)
- Credential issued (certification granted)
- Resource was consumed/used (materials taken)
- But resource doesn't have obligations to verify - these are system state changes, not role compliance evidence

Example: Worker completes training (Role-Resource)
- Worker's evidence: Attended training sessions, completed assessments, received completion certificate
- Training system's record: Worker ID shows completion status, timestamps, assessment scores
- Compliance verified through: Worker's certificate + system's record

Not: Training's "compliance" with obligation (training is resource, not role with obligations)

**Why this matters:**
In Role-Resource interactions, verify only role's compliance. Don't try to verify resource's "obligations" because resource doesn't have role obligations - it has design requirements (must function correctly) but these are separate from accountability framework.

## 10. How This Creates Structural Accountability

### 10.1 Self-Policing Through Anticipated Checking

**Mechanism:**
Knowing others have rights to check my obligations creates psychological weight, incentivizing compliance before checking occurs.

**How it works:**

**Awareness of Rights:**
Role A knows Role B has RIGHT to verify A's obligation. A knows B CAN check, even if B doesn't check constantly.

**Anticipated Accountability:**
A thinks: "B could check this anytime. If I don't comply, B will discover violation. Better to comply now than be caught later."

**Self-Correction:**
A complies without being checked, because anticipation of potential checking is sufficient incentive.

**Not Surveillance:**
Don't need constant monitoring. Just possibility of checking creates accountability pressure.

**Example:**

Government knows families have RIGHT to RECEIVE child support.
Government knows families CAN verify payments (check bank accounts).
Government knows failure will be discovered (families will notice missing payments).
Government complies proactively (delivers payments) to avoid detection of violation.

Not because government is virtuous, but because structure creates accountability pressure.

**Why this works:**
- Reduces need for constant oversight (expensive, inefficient)
- Scales to large systems (distributed checking, not centralized surveillance)
- Works regardless of virtue (even bad actors respond to accountability pressure)
- Creates sustainable accountability (not dependent on enforcement resources)

### 10.2 Distributed Verification Without Central Authority

**Mechanism:**
Each role can check some other roles through their rights, creating distributed accountability network.

**How it works:**

**Multiple Checkers:**
- Role A can check Role B (through A's rights creating B's obligations)
- Role B can check Role C (through B's rights creating C's obligations)
- Role C can check Role A (through C's rights creating A's obligations)
- No single "oversight authority" needed

**Distributed Knowledge:**
- Role A knows what to check (their rights specify what B must do)
- Role B knows what to check (their rights specify what C must do)
- Each role is expert in their own rights, can verify relevant obligations

**Mutual Checking:**
- Everyone both checks and is checked
- Can't escape accountability by corrupting single authority
- Collusion requires coordinating many parties (difficult)

**Example:**

In governance system:
- Rule Users check Rule Makers (through Rule User rights to get information, challenge decisions)
- Rule Makers check Decision Makers (through submission audit, evidence requirements)
- Decision Makers check Rule Makers (through quality review, completeness audit)

No "super-overseer" checking everyone. Accountability distributed throughout system.

**Why this works:**
- Resilient to corruption (can't corrupt single point)
- Scalable (more roles = more distributed checking)
- Knowledge-appropriate (each role checks what they understand)
- No bottleneck (don't need central authority to approve everything)

### 10.3 Scalability Through Structure

**Mechanism:**
Accountability works through structure, not through individual virtue or relationships, enabling scaling to large systems.

**How it works:**

**Structure Independent of Individuals:**
- Rights and obligations are architectural
- Persist regardless of who occupies roles
- Don't depend on personal relationships
- New people entering roles inherit existing rights/obligations

**No Relationship Requirement:**
- Don't need to know each other personally
- Don't need trust or friendship
- Don't need small-group dynamics
- Structure creates accountability even between strangers

**Scales to Many:**
- Add more roles, same accountability logic applies
- Large organizations, same rights/obligations structure
- Millions of Rule Users, same verification mechanisms

**Example:**

Government serving millions of citizens:
- Each citizen has RIGHT to RECEIVE services
- Government has OBLIGATION to GIVE services
- Doesn't require personal relationship between each citizen and each government employee
- Structure creates accountability at scale

Small business with 10 employees:
- Each employee has RIGHT to RECEIVE pay
- Employer has OBLIGATION to GIVE pay
- Same structure, smaller scale

Structure scales from 10 to 10 million without changing logic.

**Why this works:**
- Architectural, not personal (doesn't require relationships)
- Modular, not holistic (each right-obligation pair independent)
- Repeatable, not unique (same structure applies to many instances)
- Formal, not informal (explicit specification enables verification)

### 10.4 Contrast with Aspirational Accountability

**Aspirational Accountability (Traditional):**

**Mechanism:**
Hope people "be ethical," "act responsibly," "serve public interest."

**Weaknesses:**
- **Unverifiable:** Can't check if someone is "ethical" (too vague)
- **Depends on virtue:** Only works if individuals are virtuous
- **Doesn't scale:** Personal virtue doesn't scale to large systems
- **No consequences:** Violation of aspiration has no clear consequence
- **Subjective:** "Responsibility" means different things to different people

**Example failure:**
"Decision Makers should make good decisions."
- What's "good"? (undefined)
- Who checks? (no one specified)
- What if they don't? (no consequence)
- Result: Decision Makers make whatever decisions they want, claim they're "good"

---

**Structural Accountability (This Framework):**

**Mechanism:**
Rights and obligations specified, verifiable through evidence, creating distributed checking.

**Strengths:**
- **Verifiable:** Can check compliance through observable evidence
- **Independent of virtue:** Structure works regardless of individual ethics
- **Scales:** Architectural approach scales to large systems
- **Has consequences:** Violations detectable and addressable
- **Objective:** Rights/obligations precisely specified

**Example success:**
"Decision Maker has OBLIGATION to MUST maintain decision quality tracing"
- What's required? Documented reasoning accessible for future review (specific)
- Who checks? Anyone with right to audit decisions (specified)
- What if violation? Evidence of decision without reasoning trail (objective)
- Result: Decision Makers maintain reasoning trail because structure requires it

---

**Comparison table:**

| Aspect | Aspirational | Structural |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Mechanism** | Personal virtue | Rights/obligations architecture |
| **Verification** | Subjective judgment | Observable evidence |
| **Scaling** | Doesn't scale (personal) | Scales (architectural) |
| **Checking** | Hope or central authority | Distributed through rights |
| **Consequences** | Vague or absent | Clear (violation detectable) |
| **Sustainability** | Depends on individuals | Persists regardless of individuals |
| **Required virtue** | High (everyone must be ethical) | Low (structure compensates) |

**Conclusion:**

Aspirational accountability is governance theater - appearance of responsibility without mechanism.

Structural accountability is governance architecture - mechanism creating responsibility through structure.

This framework uses structural accountability. Every right and obligation is checkable, creating distributed verification network that scales and persists regardless of individual virtue.

## 11. Connection to Activity Structure (Preview)

### 11.1 From Accountability to Observable Activities

Rights and obligations specify **what is owed** between roles. When these rights and obligations are enacted, they manifest as **observable activities**.

The accountability framework establishes the accountability relationships. The activity framework (Activity Specification Model) specifies how these relationships manifest as observable actions.

**Relationship between frameworks:**

**Accountability Framework (this document):**
- Defines rights and obligations
- Specifies TYPE (right/obligation), DIRECTION (give/get/receive/be taken from), DISCRETION (must/should)
- Creates checkable expectations

**Activity Framework:**
- Defines how rights/obligations manifest as actions
- Specifies Actor-Action-Object-Target structure
- Creates observable evidence

**Example connection:**

**Accountability specification:**
"Employer has OBLIGATION to MUST GIVE free safety training materials to worker"

**Activity manifestation:**
"Employer, give, materials, (to) worker"
- Actor: Employer (who)
- Action: give (what direction)
- Object: materials (what is given)
- Target: worker (to whom)

**Observable evidence:**
- Worker receives materials (physical transfer)
- Receipt signed (documentation)
- Distribution recorded (system log)

### 11.2 Integration with Activity Specification Model

The accountability framework is foundational but not complete without activity specification.

**Accountability answers:**
- What is owed? (rights and obligations)
- Who owes what to whom? (correspondence)
- Is it mandatory or rebuttable? (discretion)

**Activity specification answers:**
- How does owing manifest as action? (actor-action-object-target)
- What makes action observable? (characteristics)
- How is action verified? (evidence)

**Together:**
- Accountability creates expectations
- Activities fulfill expectations through observable actions
- Evidence verifies activities occurred
- Rights enable checking evidence
- Complete accountability loop

**Full integration detailed in Activity Specification Model.**

This accountability framework establishes the "what is owed" foundation. Activity specification builds on this foundation to specify "how obligations are fulfilled through observable actions."
