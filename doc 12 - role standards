# Open Meta-Governance Standard – Doc 12 (DRAFT)
**Role Framework**

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of This Document

This document specifies the three core roles in rule governance—Rule Users, Rule Makers, and Decision Makers—and defines their rights and obligations. These roles form the operational structure through which governance functions are performed and accountability is maintained.

Rights define what each role is guaranteed to receive or can legitimately exercise. Obligations define what each role must provide or is accountable for performing. Together, rights and obligations create the architecture for effective, legitimate governance.

### 1.2 Relationship to Other OMGS Documents

This document builds on and references:

- **Doc 03 (Legitimacy Framework)**: Establishes that Rule Users are the source of legitimacy, Decision Makers exercise delegated authority, and Rule Makers serve as administrative stewards. The legitimacy flows described in Doc 03 determine why each role has particular rights and obligations.

- **Doc 04 (Authority and Delegation)**: Explains how authority is conferred through rule chains, the distinction between authority and legitimacy, and the boundaries of delegated authority. Rights and obligations must operate within these authority structures.

- **Doc 05 (Rights and Obligations Framework)**: Provides the architectural foundation for why rights and obligations are distinguished, how they enable role function, and how they create accountability. This document applies those principles to specific roles.

- **Doc 06 (Inter-Oversight Architecture)**: Describes the triplex+ inter-oversight design pattern where Rule Users, Rule Makers, and Decision Makers check each other through complementary authority flows. Rights and obligations operationalize this mutual oversight.

- **Doc 11 (Rule Lifecycle Meta-Requirements)**: Specifies what must happen at each lifecycle stage. This document links each right and obligation to specific lifecycle meta-requirements, showing how roles interact with lifecycle processes.

### 1.3 How to Use This Document

**For rule system designers:**
Use the rights and obligations specified here to:
- Define role responsibilities clearly
- Establish accountability structures
- Enable inter-oversight mechanisms
- Ensure roles have necessary authority and protections

**For those performing governance roles:**
Use this document to understand:
- What you are guaranteed (your rights)
- What you are accountable for (your obligations)
- How your role connects to lifecycle processes (MR links)
- How your role relates to other roles (inter-oversight)

**For auditors and evaluators:**
Use this document to assess:
- Whether roles have necessary rights to function effectively
- Whether role obligations are being met
- Whether inter-oversight mechanisms are operating
- Whether role boundaries are respected

### 1.4 Overview of Three Core Roles

**Rule Users** are entities subject to rules within the rule environment. They are the ultimate source of legitimacy—governance operates on their behalf and with their consent (explicit or implicit). They have rights to be informed, consulted, and treated fairly, and obligations to provide feedback and accept accountability for non-compliance.

**Rule Makers** are entities performing administrative functions: monitoring, analysis, reporting, communication, and enforcement. They exercise authority delegated by Decision Makers to execute governance processes. They have rights to exercise professional judgment and determine operational approaches, and obligations to remain impartial, ground work in evidence, and serve the legitimacy environment.

**Decision Makers** are entities with authority to make rules binding through formal decisions. They exercise authority delegated (ultimately) by Rule Users through various mechanisms (constitutions, bylaws, contracts, etc.). They have rights to exercise legitimate authority and access evidence, and obligations to operate within authority scope, audit submissions, and maintain lifetime accountability for decisions.

These three roles create mutual oversight: Rule Makers → Decision Makers (submission audit), Decision Makers → Rule Users (rule acceptance), Rule Users → Rule Makers (feedback and behavior observation). This triplex+ inter-oversight architecture prevents concentration of unchecked power.

## 2. Rule User Role: Rights and Obligations

### 2.1 Overview of Rule User Role

Rule Users are entities subject to rules within the rule environment. As defined in Doc 01 (Concepts and Ontology), Rule Users are those whose activities are governed by rules and who fall within the scope of rule authority.

**Position in legitimacy flows (see Doc 03):**
Rule Users are the foundational source of legitimacy for the entire governance system. Whether through explicit consent (democratic participation, contractual agreement) or implicit acceptance (voluntary participation, continued acquiescence), Rule Users confer the legitimacy that makes governance effective. Without Rule User legitimacy, governance reduces to pure coercion, which is inherently unstable.

**Role in inter-oversight (see Doc 06):**
Rule Users check Decision Makers through compliance/non-compliance signals and feedback. When rules fail to serve Rule Users, non-compliance and discontent signal the need for reform. Rule Users also check Rule Makers by providing feedback on monitoring, communication, and enforcement effectiveness.

**Critical distinction:**
Not all entities affected by rules are Rule Users. External entities (foreign citizens, natural ecosystems, future generations) may be Rule Resources or considerations within the legitimacy environment, but they are not Rule Users unless they have signed up for governance (e.g., through visa, contract, citizenship). Rule Users must have both influence over them (governance can require compliance) and their consent (explicit or implicit) to be governed.

### 2.2 Rule User Rights

#### 2.2.1 Right to Legitimacy Education

##### Statement
Rule Users have the right to understand that they are the source of legitimacy for the governance system, how the system operates, their role in conferring authority, and how they can hold the system accountable.

##### Justification
Many governance systems inform Rule Users about specific rules but never explain the governance system itself: how authority flows, where it comes from, how decisions are made, or how Rule Users can participate or challenge rules. This leaves Rule Users feeling powerless and often resentful when rules fail them, because they don't understand they have legitimate means to demand reform.

Legitimacy education is not just civics instruction ("here's how government works") but empowerment education ("you are the source of authority, here's how to exercise your power responsibly"). When Rule Users reach age of adult responsibility, they should understand:
- They are part of the legitimacy collective providing authority to governance
- How authority is delegated and can be withdrawn
- Their rights and obligations within the system
- How to participate, provide feedback, and demand accountability

This right is particularly critical for young people transitioning to adult status (see MR-6.2 for continuous announcement to new entrants and MR-7.1 for comprehension requirements). Starting education at age 16 for rules applying at age 18 allows adequate preparation time.

Without legitimacy education, Rule Users may view rules as arbitrary impositions rather than structures they collectively authorize. This undermines both compliance and the quality of governance (Rule Users who don't understand their power can't exercise it effectively).

##### Linked Meta-Requirements
- **MR-6.2 (Continuous Applicability Awareness)**: Announcement must reach new Rule Users continuously as they enter scope. For young people, this includes pre-adult notification allowing time for education.
- **MR-7.1 (User-Centered Comprehension)**: Communication must be designed for Rule User comprehension in their context. Legitimacy education is part of making governance comprehensible.

---

#### 2.2.2 Right to Announcement Before Effectiveness

##### Statement
Rule Users have the right to be formally notified that a rule exists and applies to them before the rule becomes binding and enforceable. They cannot be held accountable for rules they don't know exist.

##### Justification
Holding someone accountable for a rule they couldn't have known about violates fundamental fairness. This right operationalizes the principle that ignorance of rules is a legitimate defense when the governance system failed to announce.

Announcement is distinct from communication:
- **Announcement** = making Rule Users aware the rule exists and applies to them
- **Communication** = helping Rule Users understand and comply with the rule

Both are required, but announcement must come first. This right ensures announcement happens before effectiveness, creating a temporal sequence: announcement → effectiveness → enforcement.

This right applies continuously, not just at initial rule creation. As new Rule Users enter scope (immigrants, young people reaching adulthood, new employees, new system users), they must receive announcement. Governance systems that announce once at rule creation and never again fail this right for future entrants.

The announcement need not be individually personalized (though it can be), but it must be structured to reach Rule Users in their context. Burying announcement in obscure publications or using inaccessible formats (complex legal language, languages Rule Users don't speak) undermines the right even if technically "announced."

##### Linked Meta-Requirements
- **MR-6.1 (Authority Visibility)**: Rule Users must be able to verify that rule came from legitimate authority. Announcement includes authority information.
- **MR-6.2 (Continuous Applicability Awareness)**: Announcement function operates continuously as new Rule Users enter scope, not just once at rule creation.
- **MR-6.3 (Temporal Precedence Over Effectiveness)**: Announcement must occur before rule becomes effective and enforceable. Cannot hold Rule Users accountable for rules not yet announced.

---

#### 2.2.3 Right to Comprehensible Communication

##### Statement
Rule Users have the right to receive communication that enables understanding of what rules require and how to comply, not just formal notification that rules exist. Communication must be designed for Rule User comprehension in their context and circumstances.

##### Justification
Announcement makes Rule Users aware rules exist. Communication enables them to comply. Without comprehensible communication, announcement is insufficient—Rule Users know they're subject to rules but don't understand what's required.

Comprehension requires more than translating rules into plain language (though that's necessary). It requires:
- **Context adaptation**: Communication in language, format, channels Rule Users actually use
- **Actionable guidance**: Not just "what's prohibited" but "here's what to do instead"
- **Support for compliance**: Resources, tools, training to enable actual behavior change
- **Ongoing availability**: Communication when Rule Users need it (not just initial publication)

This right is particularly important for:
- Complex technical rules (data protection, safety standards)
- Rules affecting diverse populations (multilingual, varying literacy levels)
- Rules requiring behavior change (not just prohibitions but new practices)
- Rules with significant consequences (criminal penalties, loss of access)

The goal is maximizing cooperative compliance (Rule Users who understand and agree choose to comply) rather than relying primarily on enforcement. Communication designed for comprehension achieves better outcomes at lower cost than enforcement-heavy approaches.

Rule Users who received comprehensible communication and still don't comply have made informed choices and can be held accountable. Rule Users who never received comprehensible communication cannot fairly be held fully accountable.

##### Linked Meta-Requirements
- **MR-7.1 (User-Centered Comprehension)**: Communication must be designed from Rule User perspective, not rule maker convenience. Success measured by Rule User comprehension, not communication effort.
- **MR-7.2 (Actionable Guidance)**: Communication must enable Rule Users to translate understanding into compliant action. Not just "what" but "how."
- **MR-7.3 (Maximization of Cooperative Compliance)**: Communication should maximize willing compliance, reducing need for enforcement. Better communication = better outcomes.

---

#### 2.2.4 Right to Communication Before Negative Enforcement

##### Statement
Rule Users have the right to receive communication enabling understanding and opportunity to comply before facing negative enforcement (penalties, sanctions, restrictions). Punishment without prior communication opportunity violates fairness.

##### Justification
This right operationalizes fairness in enforcement: cannot punish what Rule Users couldn't reasonably know or understand. The sequence must be:

1. **Announcement**: Rule User becomes aware rule exists
2. **Communication**: Rule User receives support to understand and comply  
3. **Non-compliance**: Rule User fails to comply despite opportunity
4. **Negative enforcement**: Penalties/sanctions applied

Skipping steps 2-3 (going directly from announcement to enforcement) violates this right.

**Important clarifications:**

**Positive enforcement (rewards, recognition) doesn't require prior communication** beyond announcement. Can reward compliance immediately after announcement because rewards don't harm Rule Users who haven't yet received communication support.

**Negative enforcement (penalties, sanctions) requires both announcement and communication** have occurred first. Must ensure Rule User had fair opportunity to understand and comply before punishment.

**Communication precedence doesn't mean unlimited delay.** After reasonable communication opportunity, negative enforcement is legitimate. "Reasonable" depends on:
- Rule complexity (simple vs complex requirements)
- Rule User capability (sophistication, resources)
- Compliance support available (tools, training, assistance)
- Consequences severity (minor penalty vs major sanction)

**Emergency exceptions may exist** (immediate danger, fraud in progress) but should be explicitly justified and limited. Default requirement remains: communication before negative enforcement.

This right reflects the principle that enforcement exists to improve compliance, not to punish. If Rule User never had fair opportunity to understand and comply, punishment is unjust and ineffective (doesn't improve future behavior).

##### Linked Meta-Requirements
- **MR-8.2 (Announcement and Communication Precedence for Negative Enforcement)**: Negative enforcement cannot occur until both announcement and communication have been provided to Rule User. Positive enforcement only requires announcement.

---

#### 2.2.5 Right to Be Consulted Before Rule Changes

##### Statement
Rule Users have the right to be directly consulted about their experiences, perspectives, and input before new rules are created or existing rules are substantially changed. "Nothing about us without us"—Rule Users should have voice in rules affecting them.

##### Justification
This right serves two purposes:

**1. Legitimacy (normative):**
Rules gain legitimacy when those governed have opportunity for input. Consultation shows respect for Rule User agency and dignity. It acknowledges that Rule Users aren't just subjects to be governed but participants in governance. Even when Decision Makers must make difficult choices Rule Users dislike, consultation creates legitimacy through participation.

**2. Information quality (pragmatic):**
Rule Users understand their reality better than distant Rule Makers. They know:
- What constraints they face in compliance
- What motivates their behavior
- Why rules work or don't work in practice
- What unintended consequences rules create
- What alternatives might work better

Consultation isn't "asking permission"—Decision Makers retain authority to decide. But it is recognizing Rule Users as valuable sources of understanding. Rules designed without Rule User input often fail because they don't reflect actual conditions.

**What consultation means:**

**Proactive input during analysis:** Before rules are designed, consult Rule Users about problems, needs, constraints. Design rules informed by Rule User reality.

**Feedback during monitoring:** Continuously gather Rule User perspectives on how rules are working. This is ongoing consultation, not one-time events.

**Mechanisms matter:** Must use methods that actually reach Rule Users and enable meaningful input. Formal comment periods that only engaged experts reach may not satisfy this right. Need diverse consultation approaches: forums, surveys, interviews, advisory committees, pilot programs, etc.

**Not everyone agrees:** Rule User populations are diverse. Consultation doesn't mean unanimous agreement or satisfying everyone. It means Decision Makers heard different perspectives and considered them in decisions.

This right creates accountability: Rule Makers who don't consult produce worse rules. Decision Makers who ignore consultation without explanation undermine legitimacy.

##### Linked Meta-Requirements
- **MR-2.3 (Direct Consultation with Rule Users)**: Monitoring must include direct consultation, not just passive observation. Rule Users must have opportunity to voice perspectives on rules affecting them.

---

#### 2.2.6 Right to Evidence-Based and Fair Enforcement

##### Statement
Rule Users have the right to enforcement based on actual observed violations (not suspicion, bias, or arbitrary selection) and applied consistently according to stated enforcement approach (not selective or discriminatory application).

##### Justification
This right protects Rule Users from arbitrary, biased, or selective enforcement—which undermines both fairness and governance effectiveness.

**Evidence requirement (see MR-8.3):**
Negative enforcement requires monitoring evidence of actual non-compliance. Cannot punish based on:
- Suspicion without evidence
- Demographic profiling or bias
- Arbitrary selection for enforcement
- Hearsay or unreliable information

Evidence must be traceable to monitoring observations. If enforcement challenges arise, Rule User can request evidence and Rule Makers must provide it.

**Consistency requirement (see MR-8.4):**
Enforcement approach must be applied consistently:
- Similar violations treated similarly
- Stated escalation paths followed
- No favoritism or discrimination
- Enforcement criteria applied equally

This doesn't mean mechanical rigidity (context matters, circumstances vary), but does mean:
- No different treatment for politically connected vs powerless Rule Users
- No selective enforcement targeting disfavored groups
- No changing enforcement approach arbitrarily

**Why this matters:**

**Fairness:** Rule Users deserve equal treatment under rules. Selective enforcement is unjust.

**Effectiveness:** Inconsistent enforcement undermines compliance. If Rule Users perceive arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement, they lose trust in system and compliance motivation weakens.

**Legitimacy:** Enforcement that violates this right erodes legitimacy. Even Rule Users who benefit from selective non-enforcement recognize system is broken.

**Remedies for violations:**
- Rule Users can challenge enforcement lacking evidence
- Patterns of selective enforcement can trigger review
- Rule Makers who violate this right face accountability through inter-oversight

##### Linked Meta-Requirements
- **MR-8.3 (Evidentiary Requirement for Negative Enforcement)**: Negative enforcement must be grounded in monitoring evidence of actual violations. Cannot enforce based on suspicion or bias.
- **MR-8.4 (Consistency Requirement for Positive Enforcement)**: Positive enforcement must be applied consistently to similar compliance achievements. No arbitrary favoritism.

---

#### 2.2.7 Right to Express Discontent

##### Statement
Rule Users have the right to express dissatisfaction, concerns, complaints, or criticisms about rules, governance processes, or enforcement without retaliation. Discontent signals are essential for governance responsiveness and early detection of legitimacy erosion.

##### Justification
Governance systems need feedback to function effectively. If Rule Users cannot safely express discontent, the system operates blind to its own failures.

**What this right protects:**

**Complaints about specific rules:** "This rule doesn't work," "This rule is unfair," "This rule creates unintended harm"

**Criticism of governance processes:** "Rule Makers are biased," "Decision Makers aren't listening to us," "Enforcement is discriminatory"

**General dissatisfaction:** "This system isn't serving us," "Legitimacy is eroding," "Reform is needed"

**Without retaliation:** Rule Users who express discontent cannot be punished for doing so. This doesn't protect Rule Users from consequences of actual non-compliance, but does protect speech/expression of concerns.

**Why this right is critical:**

**Early warning system:** Discontent signals problems before they become crises. Systems that suppress discontent miss opportunities to reform before legitimacy collapse.

**Quality improvement:** Rule User complaints often identify real problems Rule Makers didn't notice. Discontent feedback improves governance.

**Legitimacy maintenance:** Rule Users who can voice concerns and see them addressed feel heard and retain trust. Rule Users who are silenced withdraw legitimacy.

**Distinction from other rights:**

This right is broader than consultation (which is about input before decisions). This covers ongoing feedback, criticism, complaints at any time about anything.

**Limitations:**

This right doesn't require governance to satisfy every complaint or make changes Rule Users demand. It requires:
- Rule Users can express discontent safely
- Discontent is heard and considered
- Patterns of discontent trigger analysis
- Reasonable response to legitimate concerns

Discontent that is itself harmful (incitement to violence, harassment) isn't protected, but even harsh criticism of governance must be protected.

##### Linked Meta-Requirements
- **MR-2.3 (Direct Consultation with Rule Users)**: Consultation includes receiving discontent feedback. Rule Users must be able to voice dissatisfaction.
- **MR-2.1 (Systemic Observation)**: Monitoring must observe Rule User feedback and discontent signals. These are part of understanding rule environment state.

---

### 2.3 Rule User Obligations

#### 2.3.1 Obligation to Provide Feedback

##### Statement
Rule Users have an obligation to provide feedback about their experiences with rules, compliance challenges, environment changes, and governance effectiveness. This feedback is essential input for monitoring and enables evidence-based governance.

##### Justification
This is reciprocal obligation to the right to be consulted. While Rule Users have the right to consultation, they also have obligation to participate when consulted.

**Why feedback is obligation, not just courtesy:**

**Governance depends on Rule User input.** Without Rule User feedback:
- Monitoring can observe behavior but misses motivation and constraint understanding
- Analysis lacks critical information about feasibility and impacts
- Rules are designed in ignorance of Rule User reality
- System can't detect problems until they become severe

**Rule Users have information governance needs:** They know:
- Whether rules are working or failing in practice
- What compliance challenges exist
- What's changing in environment
- Where rules create unintended consequences
- What alternatives might work better

**This isn't demanding excessive burden.** Feedback obligation means:
- Respond when consulted (reasonable response expected)
- Provide honest information about experiences
- Alert Rule Makers to serious problems
- Participate in consultation mechanisms when feasible

**It doesn't mean:**
- Constant detailed reporting
- Answering every survey
- Attending every meeting
- Serving as unpaid consultants

**Practical implementation:**

Governance should make feedback easy:
- Multiple channels (surveys, hotlines, forums, direct contact)
- Low burden (quick, accessible, convenient)
- Responsive (feedback acknowledged and considered)
- Safe (no retaliation for honest feedback)

Rule Users who never provide feedback despite opportunities undermine their own interests. Governance without Rule User input serves Rule Users poorly.

**Relationship to other obligations:**

This is distinct from accountability for non-compliance (2.3.2). That's about accepting consequences for rule violations. This is about providing information to improve rules.

Rule Users who don't comply can still provide valuable feedback about why rules don't work. Feedback obligation exists independently of compliance status.

##### Linked Meta-Requirements
- **MR-2.1 (Systemic Observation)**: Monitoring must observe Rule User activities and perspectives. Rule User feedback enables monitoring effectiveness.
- **MR-2.3 (Direct Consultation with Rule Users)**: Consultation effectiveness depends on Rule User participation. Feedback obligation supports consultation function.

---

#### 2.3.2 Accountability for Non-Compliance

##### Statement
Rule Users who do not comply with rules—after proper announcement and communication—are accountable and subject to enforcement. This is consequence of being subject to rules, not punishment for its own sake.

##### Justification
This isn't labeled "obligation to comply" because OMGS recognizes Rule Users have choice. They can choose non-compliance for various reasons:
- Disagreement with rules
- Civil disobedience
- Cost-benefit calculation
- Inability to comply despite trying
- Unconscious non-compliance (mistakes, forgetfulness)

But choice has consequences. Accountability means:
- Rule Users who don't comply face enforcement (designed to improve compliance)
- Enforcement is legitimate after announcement and communication provided
- Rule Users can't claim "didn't know" after receiving announcement and communication

**Critical prerequisites for accountability:**

**1. Proper announcement (see 2.2.2):** Rule User must have been notified rule exists and applies to them.

**2. Adequate communication (see 2.2.3, 2.2.4):** For negative enforcement, Rule User must have had opportunity to understand requirements and receive support for compliance.

**3. Evidence of non-compliance (see 2.2.6):** Enforcement must be based on actual observed violations, not suspicion or bias.

**4. Within Rule User capability:** If Rule User literally cannot comply (physical impossibility, resource constraints), accountability is inappropriate. Rules should be designed for feasibility.

**What accountability means:**

**Enforcement mechanisms applied:** As designed in rules and communicated to Rule Users. This could include:
- Warnings and reminders (gentle enforcement)
- Penalties or sanctions (negative enforcement)
- Loss of benefits or privileges
- Required corrective actions

**Proportionate to violation:** Enforcement should match severity of non-compliance. Minor violations don't warrant severe sanctions.

**Designed for compliance improvement:** Enforcement exists to improve future compliance, not just punish past violations. Effective enforcement changes behavior.

**What accountability doesn't mean:**

**Not absolute obedience:** Rule Users can argue rules are wrong, advocate for change, even engage in civil disobedience. But they accept consequences.

**Not punishment without due process:** Accountability requires fair process, evidence, opportunity to respond to allegations.

**Not endless expansion:** Accountability only for actual rule violations, not for thinking wrong thoughts or expressing criticism.

**Relationship to legitimacy:**

When governance fails Rule Users badly enough (rules unjust, enforcement abusive, no reform despite discontent), Rule Users may collectively withdraw legitimacy. This is ultimate check on governance, not violation of accountability obligation.

But individual non-compliance isn't legitimacy withdrawal—it's choice Rule Users make knowing enforcement consequences.

##### Linked Meta-Requirements
- **MR-8.1 (Compliance Improvement as Design Principle)**: Enforcement exists to improve compliance, not punish for punishment's sake. Accountability serves this purpose.
- **MR-8.2 (Announcement and Communication Precedence for Negative Enforcement)**: Accountability for negative enforcement only legitimate after announcement and communication provided.
- **MR-8.3 (Evidentiary Requirement for Negative Enforcement)**: Accountability requires evidence of actual non-compliance, not suspicion.
- **MR-8.4 (Consistency Requirement for Positive Enforcement)**: Accountability (positive and negative) must be applied consistently.

## 3. Rule Maker Role: Rights and Obligations

### 3.1 Overview of Rule Maker Role

Rule Makers are entities performing the administrative functions of governance: monitoring environment and rule effectiveness, analyzing evidence, designing rule solutions, reporting to Decision Makers, communicating with Rule Users, and enforcing rules. They execute the operational work that converts environment change into rule changes and rules into actual behavior change.

**Position in legitimacy flows (see Doc 03):**
Rule Makers exercise authority delegated by Decision Makers (who in turn received authority from Rule Users). They serve the legitimacy environment—their role is stewardship, not political authority. Rule Makers implement decisions but don't make binding decisions themselves.

**Role in inter-oversight (see Doc 06):**
Rule Makers are checked by Decision Makers (who audit submissions and can reject inadequate work) and by Rule Users (who provide feedback on Rule Maker performance and can complain about bias or dysfunction). Rule Makers check Decision Makers by providing evidence-based submissions that constrain arbitrary decisions.

**Critical requirement:**
Rule Makers must operate impartially (see Doc 05). Because they control so much of the governance process (what evidence is gathered, how it's analyzed, what solutions are proposed, how rules are communicated and enforced), impartiality is essential. Bias in Rule Maker work corrupts entire governance system.

### 3.2 Rule Maker Rights

#### 3.2.1 Right to Exercise Professional Judgment in Analysis and Design

##### Statement
Rule Makers have the right to exercise professional judgment, expertise, and creativity in analyzing evidence, framing problems, designing solutions, and recommending approaches. They are not mechanical executors but knowledge workers making consequential choices.

##### Justification
Analysis and design are intellectual work requiring judgment, not algorithmic processes. Rule Makers must make choices about:

**Problem framing:** What's the core issue? What's causing it? What outcomes do we seek?

**Solution design:** Which user activities should be governed? What rule requirements will achieve outcomes? What enforcement mechanisms will work?

**Approach selection:** What monitoring methods? What communication channels? What analysis frameworks?

These choices require expertise, creativity, contextual knowledge, and judgment. No formula dictates "correct" answers. Different Rule Makers might reasonably choose different approaches.

**This right protects:**

**Professional autonomy:** Rule Makers can't be micromanaged by Decision Makers on how to do analysis. Decision Makers review outputs and can reject inadequate work, but don't prescribe analytical methods.

**Intellectual integrity:** Rule Makers can recommend solutions they believe best serve legitimacy environment, even if Decision Makers might prefer different approaches politically.

**Innovation and creativity:** Rule Makers can propose novel solutions, new approaches, creative mechanisms rather than being limited to established patterns.

**Reasonable disagreement:** When evidence supports multiple interpretations or solutions, Rule Makers can choose based on professional judgment.

**This right doesn't protect:**

**Bias or partiality:** Professional judgment must be impartial. Judgment favoring particular Rule Users, serving political convenience, or ignoring evidence violates obligations.

**Incompetence:** Poor analysis due to lack of expertise or effort isn't protected as "judgment." Decision Makers can reject incompetent work.

**Bad faith:** Using "judgment" to justify predetermined conclusions, ignoring evidence, or serving personal interests violates obligations.

**Relationship to obligations:**

This right enables Rule Maker function, but obligations constrain its exercise:
- Judgment must be evidence-based (3.3.2)
- Judgment must serve environment outcomes (3.3.6)
- Judgment must be impartial (3.3.1)

Balance: Rule Makers have discretion within ethical bounds and evidentiary constraints.

**Examples:**

**Protected judgment:** Rule Maker analyzes evidence showing multiple enforcement approaches could work, recommends approach A based on feasibility assessment. Decision Maker can choose approach B instead, but Rule Maker exercised legitimate judgment.

**Not protected:** Rule Maker ignores evidence favoring approach A because politically convenient approach B
