# Activity Specification Model

## 1. Activities: The Fundamental Reality of Governance

### 1.1 What Governance Actually Is

Governance is not abstract policies, intentions, or aspirations. Governance is not rules written on paper or principles declared in speeches.

**Governance is activities** - observable actions performed by specific actors at specific times with specific objects and targets.

When a Rule Maker monitors user behavior, that is an activity. When a Decision Maker approves a policy, that is an activity. When a Rule User complies with a requirement, that is an activity. When enforcement applies a consequence, that is an activity.

**Everything in governance reduces to activities.**

Rules describe which activities should or should not occur. Policies specify how activities must be performed. Enforcement responds when required activities don't occur or prohibited activities do occur. Monitoring observes whether activities happen. Analysis evaluates activity patterns. Decisions change which activities are required.

**At its fundamental level, governance IS the totality of activities occurring within a collective.**

Understanding this is essential because:
- Activities are observable reality (can be seen, recorded, evidenced)
- Activities are specific and concrete (not vague or abstract)
- Activities are verifiable (can determine if they occurred)
- Activities are attributable (can identify who performed them)
- Activities are governable (can influence whether they occur)

**Without activities, there is no governance - only words about governance.**

### 1.2 The Problem: Obscuring Abstractions

Most governance discourse operates at the wrong level of abstraction. It uses language that obscures rather than reveals what actually happens.

**Examples of obscuring abstractions:**

"Ensure responsible data handling"
- What activities does "ensure" require?
- What activities constitute "responsible"?
- What is "data handling" in activity terms?

"Maintain governance oversight"
- What activities does "maintain" involve?
- What activities constitute "oversight"?
- Who performs which specific actions?

"Exercise due diligence"
- What activities does "exercise" mean?
- What activities constitute "diligence"?
- How would you observe "due" happening?

**These abstractions create blackboxes** - areas where governance operates invisibly, where compliance cannot be verified, where accountability cannot be established.

**The problem is not that abstractions are wrong.** Abstractions serve useful purposes - they summarize, they generalize, they communicate at high level. The problem is that **governance has confused abstractions with reality.**

Organizations write policies using abstractions, then believe they have governance. But if you cannot observe the activities these abstractions refer to, you cannot verify compliance, cannot collect evidence, cannot enforce requirements.

**"Ensure responsible data handling" is not governable.**
**"Employee, encrypts, customer file, before transmission" is governable.**

The first is abstraction - beautiful language signifying nothing observable.
The second is activity - specific, observable, verifiable, enforceable.

**Current governance is more complicated than necessary precisely because it operates in abstraction rather than reality.** When abstractions don't work, organizations add more abstractions - more policies, more principles, more frameworks - creating layer upon layer of obscuring language.

**The complexity people experience in governance is not inherent complexity of reality. It is complicatedness created by obscuring abstractions.**

### 1.3 The Solution: Revealing Atomic Reality

The solution is not to add new concepts or frameworks. The solution is to remove obscuring layers and see clearly what was always there.

**People already understand activities.** Everyone:
- Performs activities daily
- Observes others performing activities
- Thinks naturally about what people do
- Knows when activities occur or don't occur

**Activities are intuitive reality.** A child understands "she took the toy" without needing theory. An adult understands "he accessed the database" without needing framework.

**What people learned through governance training is the abstractions that obscure this natural understanding.** They learned to say "ensure responsible behavior" instead of "employee stores file in safe." They learned to write "maintain oversight" instead of "manager reviews weekly report."

**The Activity Specification Model does not teach new concept. It enables unlearning the obscuring abstractions.**

Like peeling layers of paint to reveal original wood:
- Paint isn't fake (it's real paint)
- But paint obscures the wood underneath
- Removing paint reveals what was always there
- The wood is more beautiful than the paint

Similarly:
- Abstractions aren't fake (they're real language)
- But abstractions obscure activities underneath
- Removing abstractions reveals what was always happening
- Activities are clearer than abstractions

**This is about emptying the mind of mess to make space for clarity.**

Practitioners already have intuitive understanding of activities. They just learned to obscure that understanding with governance abstractions. **Unlearning the abstractions restores natural clarity.**

### 1.4 How Activities Enable AI-Enabled Governance

Activities are not just intuitive for humans. Activities are inherently systematic in ways that enable AI to process them.

**Activities have natural structure:**
- Actor performs action on object toward target (systematic)
- Actions transform or move objects (classifiable)
- Activities leave observable traces (verifiable)
- Activities compose in regular patterns (predictable)

**This structure exists naturally - we're not creating it for AI, we're revealing structure that was always present.**

Like atomic structure in chemistry:
- Atoms had structure before humans discovered it
- Discovering atomic structure enabled chemistry to advance
- AI can work with atomic structure because structure is real

Similarly:
- Activities have structure whether humans see it or not
- Revealing activity structure enables governance to advance
- AI can work with activity structure because structure is real

**Why AI excels with activities:**

**Clarity:** AI processes clear specifications well. "Employee, encrypts, file, before transmission" is clear. "Ensure security" is vague.

**Modularity:** AI processes independent units well. Each activity is independent unit. Abstractions blur boundaries.

**Observability:** AI verifies through observation. Activities are observable. Abstractions are not.

**Systematicity:** AI applies consistent rules. Activity structure is consistent. Abstractions vary interpretation.

**This is like old-style law, medicine, engineering** - domains where AI excels because underlying reality has clarity. Statutes specify observable requirements. Medical diagnoses reference observable symptoms. Engineering specs define measurable characteristics.

**Activities bring governance into this domain of clarity.**

**The vision: AI ingests OMGS, applies Activity Model to assess existing governance frameworks, identifies gaps/duplications/blackboxes, generates evidence-based recommendations.**

Not AI "governing humans" but AI enabling better governance by revealing what current abstractions obscure.

**Humans provide strategic oversight and "why" thinking. AI handles systematic application and "what/how" execution.**

This division works because activities provide the clear foundation both can operate on.

## 2. The Atom: Universal Structure of Activities

### 2.1 Actor-Action-Object-Target: The Four Components

Every activity - regardless of domain, context, or complexity - has four fundamental components:

**Actor:** Who performs the activity
**Action:** What operation occurs
**Object:** What the action applies to, affects, or manipulates
**Target:** To/from whom or where (direction/destination/source)

**This is not arbitrary framework. This is structure inherent in observable reality.**

Consider any activity:
- Someone (actor) does something (action) to something (object) in some direction (target)
- "John threw the ball to Mary" - John (actor), threw (action), ball (object), to Mary (target)
- "System encrypted the file" - incomplete, missing target
- "System encrypted the file for transmission" - System (actor), encrypted (action), file (object), for transmission (target)

**If any component is missing or vague, the activity is incompletely specified.**

Incomplete specification means:
- Cannot fully observe (don't know what to look for)
- Cannot verify compliance (don't know what counts)
- Cannot collect evidence (don't know what proves occurrence)
- Cannot attribute responsibility (don't know who did what)
- Cannot enforce (don't know what to require)

**Complete specification requires all four components to be specific and observable.**

### 2.2 Actor: Who Performs the Activity

The actor is who or what performs the activity.

**Actor must be specific and identifiable:**

**Specific:**
- Not "employees" but "Employee #1234" or "employees in role X"
- Not "the system" but "authentication module" or "database server"
- Not "management" but "Department Manager" or "CEO"

**Identifiable:**
- Can determine which specific individual or system component
- Can attribute activity to responsible party
- Can trace back from evidence to actor

**Actor types:**

**Individual:** Specific person (Employee John Smith, Customer ID 5678)
**Role-holder:** Person occupying role (Department Manager, Shift Supervisor)
**System:** Technical component (Authentication service, Database query engine)
**Collective:** Group acting as unit (Board of Directors voting, Team deciding)

**Why actor specificity matters:**

Accountability requires attribution. If actor is vague ("someone should monitor"), cannot determine who is responsible when monitoring doesn't occur.

Enforcement requires attribution. If violation occurs but cannot identify actor, cannot apply consequences.

Verification requires attribution. If checking whether obligation fulfilled, need to identify who should have fulfilled it.

**Actor specification enables governance by making responsibility concrete.**

### 2.3 Action: What Operation Occurs

The action is what operation occurs - what change or movement happens.

**Action must be observable operation:**

Observable means someone or something can detect it occurring:
- Physical observation (watching activity happen)
- Informational traces (logs showing activity occurred)
- State changes (before/after showing activity happened)

Not observable: "Act responsibly" (how would you observe responsibility?)
Observable: "Encrypt file" (can verify encryption occurred)

Not observable: "Maintain vigilance" (how would you observe vigilance?)
Observable: "Check dashboard every hour" (can verify checks occurred)

**Actions are fundamentally about state transformations:**

Every action either:
- Moves object from one location/possession to another (spatial/possessional state change)
- Transforms object's intrinsic properties (internal state change)
- Both
- Neither (maintains current state)

This classification (explored in Section 3) provides universal taxonomy - every possible action maps to one of four quadrants based on whether it moves and whether it transforms.

**Action naming:**

Actions should be named consistently:
- Use clear verbs (create, move, transform, store, retrieve, delete, modify)
- Avoid vague verbs (ensure, maintain, support, facilitate)
- Prefer specific operations (encrypt, transmit, archive) over general ones (process, handle, manage)

**Action specification enables governance by making operations concrete.**

### 2.4 Object: What the Action Applies To

The object is what the action applies to, affects, or manipulates.

**Object identification determines everything about how to specify and govern the activity.**

**Object types:**

**Physical objects:** Files, devices, materials, products, locations
**Informational objects:** Data, records, documents, messages, logs
**Status objects:** States, conditions, privileges, permissions
**Comprehension objects:** Understanding, knowledge (in people's minds)
**People as objects:** Rule Users being transformed (comprehension change, status change)

**Critical insight: The object is not always what you initially think.**

Example: Communication activity
- Initial thought: Object is "message being communicated"
- Actually: Object is "Rule User being transformed from not-understanding to understanding"

Example: Enforcement activity
- Initial thought: Object is "consequence being applied"
- Actually: Object is "Rule User being transformed from non-compliant to sanctioned"

**Getting object identification right is essential because:**
- Object determines observable characteristics (what to observe)
- Object determines state changes (what transformation means)
- Object determines verification method (how to check)
- Object determines evidence type (what proves occurrence)

**Object must be specific:**

Not "data" but "customer record #12345"
Not "document" but "policy document version 3.2"
Not "system" but "authentication database"

**Object specification enables governance by making targets of action concrete.**

### 2.5 Target: To/From Whom or Where

The target is the direction, destination, or source of the action - to/from whom or where.

**Target distinguishes object from recipient/location:**

"John sends file to Mary"
- Object: file (what is sent)
- Target: Mary (to whom)

"System retrieves data from database"
- Object: data (what is retrieved)
- Target: database (from where)

"Employee stores document in safe"
- Object: document (what is stored)
- Target: safe (to where)

**Target can be:**
- Recipient (to whom something goes)
- Source (from whom something comes)
- Destination (to where something moves)
- Origin (from where something moves)
- Context (within what environment)

**When target is implicit vs explicit:**

Sometimes target is implicit in action:
- "Employee accesses database" - target (database) is implicit in "accesses database"
- Could be explicit: "Employee, accesses, data, from database"

**Make target explicit when:**
- Direction matters for governance (from unmanaged device vs from managed device)
- Multiple possible targets exist (to internal storage vs to external cloud)
- Target determines compliance (to authorized recipient vs to unauthorized)

**Target specification enables governance by making direction/destination concrete.**

### 2.6 Complete Atomic Specification Format

An activity is completely specified at atomic level when:

**1. All four components are present:**
- Actor identified
- Action named
- Object identified
- Target specified (explicitly or implicitly)

**2. Each component is specific:**
- Not vague or abstract
- Not ambiguous
- Not blackboxed

**3. Each component is observable:**
- Can detect when present/absent
- Can verify through evidence
- Can attribute to responsible party

**Standard format:**

**Actor, Action, Object, (Target)**

Where (Target) may be implicit in action or explicit as separate component.

**Examples of complete atomic specification:**

"Employee #1234, encrypts, customer file #5678, before transmission"
- Actor: Employee #1234
- Action: encrypts
- Object: customer file #5678
- Target: (implicit in "before transmission" - for transmission)

"Rule Maker, creates, monitoring record, about user activity"
- Actor: Rule Maker
- Action: creates
- Object: monitoring record
- Target: about user activity

"Decision Maker, approves, proposal #123, (in decision log)"
- Actor: Decision Maker
- Action: approves
- Object: proposal #123
- Target: in decision log

**Testing completeness:**

Ask for each activity:
- Can I identify exactly who performs this? (Actor complete)
- Can I observe this operation occurring? (Action complete)
- Can I identify exactly what is affected? (Object complete)
- Do I know direction/destination/source? (Target complete)

If answer is "no" or "unclear" to any question, specification is incomplete.

**Incomplete specification = ungovernable activity.**

## 3. Action Taxonomy: Universal Classification by State Outcomes

### 3.1 The Two Dimensions of State Change

Every action can be classified by its effect on object state across two independent dimensions:

**Dimension 1: Spatial/Possessional State**
- **Moving:** Object changes location or possession
- **Not Moving:** Object remains in same location or possession

**Dimension 2: Intrinsic State**
- **Transforming:** Object changes its intrinsic properties, form, or essence
- **Not Transforming:** Object maintains its intrinsic properties

**These two dimensions are complete** - they capture all possible state changes:
- An object either moves or doesn't
- An object either transforms or doesn't
- No other fundamental state change types exist

**This creates four quadrants:**
```
                    MOVING              NOT MOVING
                    
TRANSFORMING        Q1                  Q2
                    Move + Transform    Transform Only
                    
NOT TRANSFORMING    Q3                  Q4
                    Move Only           Maintain
```

**Every action maps to exactly one quadrant based on its effect on object state.**

This is not arbitrary categorization. This is classification based on physical reality of what actions do to objects.

### 3.2 Quadrant 1: Moving + Transforming

**Characteristics:** Object both changes location/possession AND changes intrinsic state.

**Example: Meteorite burning in atmosphere**
- Moving: Meteorite traveling through space toward Earth
- Transforming: Meteorite burning (material transforming from solid to gas/energy)
- Q1: Both occurring simultaneously

**Governance examples:**

"Rule Maker, converts, analysis, into DM submission, AND sends to DM"
- Moving: Submission goes from RM domain to DM domain
- Transforming: Analysis format converted to submission format
- Note: This is actually TWO atoms (convert [Q2], then send [Q3]) but can occur as compound

"Employee, creates, notification, AND sends to manager"
- Moving: Notification goes to manager
- Transforming: Notification created (nothing → something)

**Q1 activities are relatively uncommon in governance** because most governance operations separate transformation from movement:
- First transform (Q2)
- Then move (Q3)

When Q1 occurs, often indicates compound activity that could be decomposed.

### 3.3 Quadrant 2: Transforming Without Moving

**Characteristics:** Object changes intrinsic state but remains in same location/possession.

**Example: Burning firewood**
- Not Moving: Wood stays in fireplace (location unchanged)
- Transforming: Wood turns into energy and ash (intrinsic state changes)
- Q2: Transformation without movement

**Transformation includes three types:**

**Creation (Nothing → Something):**
"Rule Maker, creates, monitoring record, about observed event"
- Before: No record exists
- After: Record exists
- Transformation: Non-existence to existence

**Modification (Something → Something Changed):**
"Employee, encrypts, file, (in place)"
- Before: Plaintext file exists
- After: Encrypted file exists
- Transformation: State change of existing object

**Disposal (Something → Nothing):**
"Rule Maker, deletes, obsolete record, from system"
- Before: Record exists
- After: Record doesn't exist
- Transformation: Existence to non-existence

**Status Transformation:**
"Decision Maker, approves, proposal, (changing status)"
- Before: Proposal status = "pending"
- After: Proposal status = "approved"
- Transformation: Status change

**Comprehension Transformation:**
"Rule Maker, converts, Rule User, to comprehending state"
- Before: RU doesn't understand rule
- After: RU understands rule
- Transformation: Cognitive state change
- Object is the Rule User (not the content)

**Q2 is most common quadrant for governance activities:**
- Creating records (monitoring)
- Creating analysis (analysis)
- Creating decisions (decision)
- Creating enforcement records (enforcement)
- Transforming RU comprehension (communication)
- Transforming RU status (enforcement)

### 3.4 Quadrant 3: Moving Without Transforming

**Characteristics:** Object changes location/possession but intrinsic state unchanged.

**Example: Sending protected file**
- Moving: File transfers from sender to recipient
- Not Transforming: File protected so content doesn't change (intentionally)
- Q3: Movement without transformation

**Pure conveyance and transfer:**

"Rule Maker, sends, submission, to Decision Maker"
- Object: Submission document (already created/formatted)
- Moving: From RM domain to DM domain
- Not Transforming: Document content unchanged

"Rule Maker, retrieves, monitoring records, from storage"
- Object: Monitoring records
- Moving: From storage to analyst workspace
- Not Transforming: Records unchanged

"Decision Maker, moves, decision record, to public repository"
- Object: Decision record
- Moving: From private to public domain
- Not Transforming: Record content unchanged (mere conveyance)

**Q3 activities common in governance for information flows:**
- Sending submissions
- Retrieving evidence
- Announcing decisions (conveying records)
- Distributing materials

**Key characteristic: Pure movement.** Object's intrinsic properties preserved while location/possession changes.

### 3.5 Quadrant 4: Neither Moving Nor Transforming

**Characteristics:** Object neither changes location/possession nor changes intrinsic state.

**Example: Keeping file in locker**
- Not Moving: File stays in locker (location unchanged)
- Not Transforming: File content unchanged
- Q4: Preservation/maintenance

**Maintenance and preservation:**

"System, maintains, file, in secure storage"
- Object: File
- Not Moving: Stays in storage
- Not Transforming: Content preserved
- Q4: Maintaining state

"Rule Maker, observes, user activities, (without recording)"
- Object: User activities being observed
- Not Moving: Activities occur where they occur
- Not Transforming: Observer doesn't change activities
- Q4: Observation without intervention

**Q4 activities are often continuous/background:**
- Maintaining storage
- Continuous observation (before recording)
- Preserving state
- Keeping systems operational

**Q4 is least visible quadrant** because nothing changes - activities maintain status quo rather than creating observable change.

However, **Q4 failure is observable** - when maintenance stops, degradation occurs. System failures, data corruption, unauthorized access all indicate Q4 activities stopped functioning.

### 3.6 Using the Matrix for Classification

**To classify any activity:**

**Step 1: Identify the object clearly**
- What is being acted upon?
- Be precise - wrong object identification leads to wrong classification

**Step 2: Determine object state before activity**
- Where is object located/possessed?
- What are object's intrinsic properties?

**Step 3: Determine object state after activity**
- Where is object located/possessed?
- What are object's intrinsic properties?

**Step 4: Compare states**
- Did location/possession change? → Moving
- Did intrinsic properties change? → Transforming

**Step 5: Assign to quadrant**
- Moving + Transforming → Q1
- Transforming only → Q2
- Moving only → Q3
- Neither → Q4

**Common classification mistakes:**

**Mistake: Confusing message with recipient**
- Wrong: "RM sends explanation" (message is object) → Q3
- Right: "RM converts RU to comprehending" (RU is object) → Q2

**Mistake: Missing the transformation**
- Wrong: "RM announces decision" (just moving) → Q3
- Could be right if announcement IS just conveying record → Q3
- Or could be Q2 if announcement transforms (private→public status)

**Mistake: Not seeing the movement**
- Wrong: "RM analyzes evidence" (only analyzing) → Q2 only
- Right: "RM retrieves evidence, then analyzes" → Q3 (retrieve) + Q2 (analyze)

**The matrix classification enables:**
- Systematic understanding of what actions do
- Consistent specification across contexts
- AI-executable classification logic
- Clear communication about activity types

## 4. Activity Types: Domain Classification

### 4.1 Why Six Types Matter for Governance

Activities occur in different domains relative to the governance system. Understanding which domain an activity belongs to determines:
- **Where observation occurs** (inside or outside system boundary)
- **Whether governance applies** (some domains not governed)
- **What governance response triggered** (different responses for different types)
- **How to specify requirements** (domain-specific considerations)

**The six types:**
1. External Activities (outside system, affecting it)
2. Environment Activities (within ecosystem, not yet governed)
3. User Activities (what Rule Users do)
4. Rule Activities (subset of user activities being governed)
5. Administrative Activities (governance operations themselves)
6. Enforcement Activities (applying consequences)

**These types are not arbitrary categories.** They reflect fundamental boundaries in governance systems:
- System boundary (inside vs outside)
- Governance boundary (governed vs not yet governed)
- Role boundary (governed vs governors)
- Function boundary (normal operations vs consequence application)

### 4.2 External Activities

**Definition:** Activities occurring outside the system boundary that affect the system but are not governed by it.

**Characteristics:**
- Performed by actors not part of the collective
- System cannot govern these activities directly
- But these activities affect the system's environment
- System must monitor and respond to external activities

**Examples:**

**Market forces:** "Competitor, lowers, price, in market" affects organization but organization doesn't govern competitor
**Natural events:** "Storm, damages, facility, (external)" affects operations but cannot govern weather
**Regulatory changes:** "Regulator, imposes, new requirement, on industry" affects compliance obligations but organization doesn't govern regulator
**External actors:** "Customer, requests, service, from company" initiates user activities but customer not governed by company's internal rules

**Why external activities matter:**

**Causation:** External activities cause environment changes
- Market crash (external) → spending drops (environment)
- Regulation change (external) → compliance requirements change (environment)

**Monitoring requirement:** Must observe external activities to understand environment changes
- Can't respond appropriately without understanding external causes
- Analysis of environment must include external activity observation

**Boundary definition:** External activities help define system boundary
- What's inside vs outside?
- What can we govern vs must respond to?

### 4.3 Environment Activities

**Definition:** Activities occurring within the ecosystem where rules operate, but not yet being governed by specific rules.

**Characteristics:**
- Observable within system's environment
- Not targeted by current rules (but could be)
- Broader context in which user activities occur
- Potential future rule activities

**Examples:**

"Employees, communicate, via unofficial channels" - happens in organization but not governed
"Users, share, content, on platform" - observable but only subset governed by platform rules
"Citizens, conduct, transactions, in economy" - economic activity, only some governed by specific regulations

**Relationship to external activities:**
External activities affect environment → environment activities occur

Example flow:
- Pandemic (external) occurs
- Remote work increases (environment change)
- Employees work from home (environment activity)
- Some home work becomes governed (becomes rule activity)

**Why environment activities matter:**

**Context for rule activities:** Rule activities don't occur in vacuum, they occur within environment of broader activities

**Source of new rule activities:** When new governance needs arise, environment activities become candidates for becoming rule activities

**Monitoring scope:** Monitoring must observe environment activities to detect when new rules needed or existing rules no longer relevant

### 4.4 User Activities

**Definition:** All activities performed by Rule Users - the superset containing rule activities.

**Characteristics:**
- Performed by actors in Rule User role
- Broader than rule activities (includes activities not governed)
- Natural behavior of collective members
- Rule activities are subset of user activities

**Examples:**

"Employee, accesses, data" (user activity - all data access)
- "Employee, accesses, customer data, from unmanaged device" (rule activity - specific governed subset)

"Citizen, drives, vehicle" (user activity - all driving)
- "Citizen, drives, vehicle, over speed limit" (rule activity - specific governed subset)

"Platform user, posts, content" (user activity - all posting)
- "Platform user, posts, prohibited content" (rule activity - specific governed subset)

**Relationship to environment activities:**
Environment activities ⊃ User activities (in many contexts, user activities are subset of environment)

**Relationship to rule activities:**
User activities ⊃ Rule activities (always - rule activities are proper subset)

**Why this hierarchy matters:**

**Scope definition:** Rules don't govern everything users do, only specific subset
- Must be explicit about which user activities become rule activities
- Avoid over-governance (governing too many user activities)
- Avoid under-governance (missing important user activities)

**Specification precision:** "Govern user activities" is too broad
- Must specify exactly which user activities are rule activities
- Activity specification enables this precision

### 4.5 Rule Activities

**Definition:** The specific subset of user activities that rules target for governance.

**Characteristics:**
- Always subset of user activities (User activities ⊃ Rule activities)
- Explicitly specified in rule scope
- Requirements apply to these activities
- Monitoring focuses on these activities
- Enforcement responds to non-compliance with requirements on these activities

**Examples:**

"Employee, accesses, customer data, from unmanaged device" - specific rule activity within broader user activity of "access data"

"Citizen, drives, vehicle, over speed limit" - specific rule activity within broader user activity of "drive vehicle"

"Platform user, posts, hate speech content" - specific rule activity within broader user activity of "post content"

**How to identify rule activities from user activities:**

Rule activities are user activities that:
- Meet scope conditions specified in rule
- Are subject to requirements specified in rule
- Trigger administrative responses when they occur

**Specification method:**
- Start with user activities (what users naturally do)
- Identify subset needing governance (risk, coordination, protection)
- Specify that subset as rule activities
- Define requirements on rule activities

**Why rule activity identification is critical:**

**Precision:** Vague scope = unclear what's governed
- "Ensure data security" (what user activities?)
- "Access customer data from unmanaged device" (specific rule activity)

**Enforceability:** Can only enforce requirements on activities you can identify
- Can't enforce "be responsible"
- Can enforce "encrypt before transmission"

**Boundary clarity:** Users need to know which activities have requirements
- If rule activity unclear, users don't know when they're subject to rule
- Clear rule activity = clear when requirements apply

### 4.6 Administrative Activities

**Definition:** Governance operations themselves - activities performed by Rule Makers and Decision Makers to govern rule activities.

**Characteristics:**
- Performed by actors in governance roles (RM, DM)
- Operate on rule activities, user activities, or other administrative activities
- Enable governance to function
- Are themselves activities (self-referential)

**Administrative activities ARE activities** with same Actor-Action-Object-Target structure as user activities. This is fundamental - governance doesn't operate through magic, it operates through observable activities.

**Examples:**

"Rule Maker, creates, monitoring record, about user activity" - administrative activity (monitoring)
"Rule Maker, analyzes, evidence, producing findings" - administrative activity (analysis)
"Decision Maker, approves, proposal, in decision log" - administrative activity (decision)
"Rule Maker, moves, decision record, to Rule Users" - administrative activity (announcement)
"Rule Maker, converts, Rule User, to comprehending state" - administrative activity (communication)
"Rule Maker, converts, Rule User status, applying sanction" - administrative activity (enforcement)

**Relationship to rule activities:**
- Rule activities trigger administrative activities (response causation)
- When rule activity occurs (or doesn't when required), administrative response triggered
- Monitoring observes rule activities
- Analysis evaluates rule activity patterns
- Enforcement responds to rule activity violations

**Why recognizing administrative activities as activities matters:**

**Accountability:** If administrative activities are vague abstractions, cannot verify they occurred
- "Maintain oversight" (abstraction, ungovernable)
- "RM creates monitoring record weekly" (activity, governable)

**Inter-oversight:** Can verify other roles' administrative activities
- Rule Users can check: Did Rule Maker actually monitor? (check for monitoring records)
- Rule Makers can check: Did Decision Maker actually decide? (check for decision records)

**Evidence:** Administrative activities leave traces enabling verification
- Monitoring records evidence monitoring occurred
- Analysis documents evidence analysis occurred
- Decision records evidence decision occurred

### 4.7 Enforcement Activities

**Definition:** Applying consequences to violations - specific subset of administrative activities.

**Characteristics:**
- Triggered by detected violations (conditional)
- Transform Rule User status (non-compliant → sanctioned)
- Apply consequences specified in rules
- Performed by Rule Makers in enforcement role

**Relationship to administrative activities:**
Enforcement activities are subset of administrative activities, but important enough to distinguish explicitly.

**Examples:**

"Rule Maker, detects, violation, creating record"
"Rule Maker, determines, appropriate consequence, per policy"
"Rule Maker, applies, consequence, to violator"
"Rule Maker, converts, violator status, from non-compliant to sanctioned"

**Why distinguish enforcement from other administrative activities:**

**Triggering conditions:** Enforcement occurs conditionally (when violation detected), other administrative activities may be continuous or periodic

**Object transformation:** Enforcement specifically transforms Rule User status/privileges, not just creating information

**Consequence application:** Enforcement involves applying negative outcomes, requiring special consideration for fairness and proportionality

**Evidence requirements:** Enforcement requires higher evidence standards (must prove violation before applying consequence)

### 4.8 Type Relationships and Causation

Activities of different types relate to each other in systematic ways.

**Containment relationships:**

**User activities ⊃ Rule activities:**
- Rule activities are proper subset of user activities
- Not all user activities are governed
- Rules specify which user activities become rule activities

**Environment activities ⊃ User activities (in many contexts):**
- User activities occur within broader environment
- Environment includes activities not by users
- Context-dependent relationship

**Administrative activities ⊃ Enforcement activities:**
- Enforcement activities are subset of administrative activities
- All enforcement is administrative, not all administrative is enforcement

**Causal relationships:**

**External → Environment:**
- External activities cause environment changes
- Example: Pandemic (external) → Remote work increases (environment)

**Environment → User:**
- Environment changes affect what user activities occur
- Example: Remote work environment → Users work from home

**User → Rule (Subset):**
- Some user activities are rule activities
- Rules define this subset relationship

**Rule → Administrative:**
- Rule activities (or their absence) trigger administrative responses
- Example: Violation occurs → Monitoring detects → Analysis evaluates → Enforcement may apply

**Administrative → Rule (Feedback):**
- Administrative activities affect future rule activities
- Example: Enforcement consequences → Users change behavior → Different rule activities occur

**This causal web shows:**
- Activities don't occur in isolation
- Different types connect systematically
- Understanding relationships enables effective governance
- Monitoring must observe across types to understand causation

## 5. Administrative Activities: Governance Operations as Atoms

### 5.1 Breaking the Sequential Stage Illusion

The Lifecycle Framework describes six stages: Monitoring, Analysis, Decision, Announcement, Communication, Enforcement. This creates impression of sequential pipeline:
```
Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Stage 4 → Stage 5 → Stage 6 → Done
```

**This is illusion.** Stages are not sequential pipeline steps.

**Reality:** Stages are convenient names for common activity patterns. The actual reality is:

**Activities occur concurrently and interleaved:**
- Monitoring activities run continuously (not just "Stage 1")
- Analysis activities occur episodically (when evidence accumulated)
- Decision activities occur when triggered (when analysis submitted)
- Documentation activities occur after decisions (creating decision records)
- Announcement activities occur after documentation (moving records to RUs)
- Communication activities occur ongoing (not just after announcement)
- Enforcement activities occur when violations detected (not sequential)

**AND monitoring activities occur throughout ALL of this:**
- Monitoring user activities → creates "monitoring records"
- Monitoring DM decisions → creates "decision records" (this IS documentation)
- Monitoring enforcement actions → creates "enforcement records"
- Monitoring analysis work → creates "audit trails"

**Monitoring is ongoing recording function, not first stage.**

**Why this matters:**

If you think stages are sequential pipeline, you think:
- "We did monitoring (Stage 1), now we move to analysis (Stage 2), we're done with monitoring"
- Wrong - monitoring continues throughout

If you understand stages as activity pattern names, you think:
- "We're continuously performing monitoring activities, periodically performing analysis activities, occasionally performing decision activities, ongoing communication activities"
- Correct - activities interleave and concurrent

**The reality is always: specific atomic activities occurring in complex concurrent sequences, not linear pipeline of stages.**

### 5.2 Monitoring Activities: Ongoing Recording Function

**Core essence: Creating records about observed activities.**

Monitoring is not "Stage 1" - it is **ongoing recording function throughout governance**.

**What monitoring monitors:**

**User activities (traditional "monitoring"):**
"Rule Maker, observes, user activities, in environment" [Q4]
"Rule Maker, creates, monitoring record, about user activity" [Q2]
"Rule Maker, stores, monitoring record, in monitoring system" [Q3/Q4]

**Decision Maker activities (this IS documentation):**
"Rule Maker, observes, DM decision, when it occurs" [Q4]
"Rule Maker, creates, decision record, documenting DM's choice" [Q2]
"Rule Maker, stores, decision record, in decision system" [Q3/Q4]

**Enforcement activities:**
"Rule Maker, observes, enforcement actions, as they occur" [Q4]
"Rule Maker, creates, enforcement record, documenting action" [Q2]
"Rule Maker, stores, enforcement record, in enforcement system" [Q3/Q4]

**Analysis activities:**
"Rule Maker, observes, analysis work, as it occurs" [Q4]
"Rule Maker, creates, audit trail, documenting analysis" [Q2]

**The pattern is consistent:** Observe → Record → Store

This pattern applies to monitoring ANY activities - whether user activities, governance activities, or other activities.

**Why monitoring is continuous:**

Governance needs ongoing awareness of what's happening:
- User compliance (continuous observation)
- Environment changes (continuous observation)
- Governance operations themselves (continuous observation)

**If monitoring stops, governance becomes blind** - cannot respond to changes, cannot verify compliance, cannot detect problems.

**Core monitoring atoms:**

**Atom 1: Rule Maker, observes, activities, (in environment)** [Q4]
- Continuous observation without yet recording
- Watching for activities that need recording
- Q4 because no change occurs (observation doesn't transform observed)

**Atom 2: Rule Maker, creates, monitoring record, (about observed activity)** [Q2]
- Recording observation into formal record
- Transformation: Nothing → Record exists
- Q2 because creating (transforming) without moving

**Atom 3: Rule Maker, stores, monitoring record, (in monitoring system)** [Q3 or Q4]
- Placing record in storage for future retrieval
- Q3 if record moves from creation space to storage
- Q4 if record maintained in storage over time

**Observable characteristics:**
- Monitoring records exist (informational trace)
- Timestamps show when observation occurred (temporal)
- Actor attribution shows who monitored (relational)
- Record content shows what was observed (informational)

**Evidence:**
Monitoring records are evidence that monitoring activities occurred.

### 5.3 Analysis Activities: Evidence-Based Evaluation

**Core essence: Creating analysis from evidence.**

Analysis transforms raw monitoring data into evaluated findings, insights, or recommendations.

**Critical requirement: Analysis must be evidence-based.**

Evidence comes from monitoring records. Cannot analyze what wasn't monitored. This creates necessary dependency:
```
Monitoring (creates records) → Analysis (evaluates records)
```

**Core analysis atoms:**

**Atom 1: Rule Maker, retrieves, monitoring records (evidence), (from storage)** [Q3]
- Moving records from storage to analyst workspace
- Not transforming records (they remain unchanged)
- Q3 because moving without transforming

**Atom 2: Rule Maker, creates, analysis, (from evidence)** [Q2]
- Evaluating evidence and producing findings
- Transformation: Evidence → Analysis (new artifact)
- Q2 because creating without moving (analysis created in analyst workspace)

**Why analysis and reporting are distinct:**

Analysis = evaluating evidence
Reporting = making analysis actionable for DM

These are separate functions, though often performed sequentially.

**Observable characteristics:**
- Analysis documents exist (informational trace)
- Analysis references evidence sources (relational)
- Timestamps show when analysis occurred (temporal)
- Actor attribution shows who analyzed (relational)

**Evidence:**
Analysis documents are evidence that analysis activities occurred.

### 5.4 Reporting Activities: Transform and Deliver to Decision Maker

**Core essence: Making analysis actionable for Decision Maker.**

Reporting is NOT same as analysis. Reporting takes analysis and:
1. Transforms it into format DM can act on
2. Delivers it to DM

**Two distinct atoms:**

**Atom 1: Rule Maker, converts, analysis, into DM submission format** [Q2]
- Transforming analysis into actionable submission
- May include: Executive summary, recommendations, decision points
- Q2 because transforming without moving (conversion happens in RM workspace)

**Atom 2: Rule Maker, sends, submission, to Decision Maker** [Q3]
- Moving submission from RM domain to DM domain
- Not transforming content (submission already formatted)
- Q3 because moving without transforming

**Why two atoms matter:**

If you think reporting is one activity, you miss that:
- Formatting for DM is transformation (Q2)
- Delivering to DM is movement (Q3)
- Both must occur for reporting to complete

**Observable characteristics:**
- Submission document exists (informational trace)
- Submission formatted for DM action (informational)
- Submission delivered to DM (relational)
- Timestamps show when submitted (temporal)

**Evidence:**
Submission documents and delivery confirmations are evidence reporting occurred.

### 5.5 Decision Activities: Decision Maker Chooses

**Core essence: Decision Maker selects among options.**

Decision is fundamentally about choice - DM evaluates submission and chooses outcome (approve, reject, select option, defer).

**Critical distinction: Decision ≠ Documentation**

Decision Maker decides (choice activity).
Rule Maker documents that decision (monitoring activity).

These are separate activities by different actors:
- DM performs decision
- RM monitors DM's decision (creates decision record)

**Core decision atom:**

**Rule Maker, receives, submission, (from Rule Maker)** [Q3]
- Peripheral activity (enables decision but isn't decision itself)

**Decision Maker, reviews, submission, (comprehending content)** [Q2]
- DM's comprehension transforms from not-knowing-submission to knowing-submission
- Peripheral activity (enables decision but isn't decision itself)

**Decision Maker, decides, on submission, (choosing outcome)** [Q2]
- THIS is core decision activity
- Transformation: Submission under consideration → Decision made
- Q2 because transforming status without moving

**Why DM only decides:**

DM's role is judgment - evaluating options and choosing.
RM's role is operations - documenting that choice (monitoring).

If DM also documented decisions, who monitors whether DM documented accurately? Creates accountability gap.

**Separation enables verification:**
- DM decides
- RM documents (monitors DM deciding)
- Others can verify documentation against decision
- Accountability maintained

**Observable characteristics:**
- Decision outcome exists (though initially only in DM's determination)
- Later documented by RM (becomes observable through decision record)

**Evidence:**
Decision records (created by RM monitoring DM) are evidence decision occurred.

### 5.6 Documentation Activities: Monitoring DM (Clarification)

**Documentation is not separate activity type - it IS monitoring.**

Specifically: Monitoring Decision Maker's decision activities.

**Why this clarification matters:**

Some governance frameworks treat "documentation" as if it's separate function. This obscures reality:
- Monitoring monitors user activities (creates monitoring records)
- Monitoring monitors DM activities (creates decision records - this is "documentation")
- Same function, different domain

**Documentation atom:**

**Rule Maker, creates, decision record, (documenting DM's choice)** [Q2]
- Same structure as monitoring user activities
- Actor: Rule Maker (not Decision Maker)
- Action: creates (transformation: nothing → record)
- Object: decision record
- Q2 because creating without moving

**This proves monitoring is ongoing:**

If monitoring only happened in "Stage 1," who monitors DM decisions in "Stage 3"?

Answer: Monitoring continues - RM monitors DM deciding, creates decision record.

Documentation IS monitoring. Same activity pattern, applied to governance activities instead of user activities.

**Self-referential nature:**

Governance monitors itself using same mechanisms it uses to monitor governed activities. This is architectural completeness - no special cases, same model applies throughout.

### 5.7 Announcement Activities: Delivering to Rule Users

**Core essence: Moving decision records from Decision Maker domain to Rule Users.**

Announcement is about information flow - getting decision to those who need to know.

**Core announcement atoms:**

**Rule Maker, retrieves, decision record, (from DM domain)** [Q3 or Q4]
- Moving record to RM's workspace for distribution
- Or maintaining access if already accessible
- Peripheral activity

**Rule Maker, moves, decision record, to Rule Users** [Q3]
- THIS is core announcement
- Moving record from non-public to public/accessible location
- Not transforming content (mere conveyance)
- Q3 because moving without transforming

**Why "mere conveyance" matters:**

Announcement doesn't transform the decision - decision already made, already documented. Announcement just delivers that documentation to audience.

If content transformed (e.g., simplified for RU understanding), that's communication (different activity), not announcement.

**Observable characteristics:**
- Decision record published/distributed (informational + relational)
- Timestamp shows when announced (temporal)
- Recipients identifiable (relational)

**Evidence:**
Publication records, distribution logs, receipt confirmations are evidence announcement occurred.

### 5.8 Communication Activities: Transforming Rule User Comprehension

**Core essence: Converting Rule User from not-understanding to understanding.**

Communication is fundamentally transformation of Rule User's cognitive state.

**Critical insight: Object is the Rule User, not the message.**

Not: "Rule Maker sends message to Rule User" (message as object)
But: "Rule Maker converts Rule User to comprehending state" (RU as object)

**Why this matters:**

If object is message, focus is on message delivery (Q3 - just moving message).
If object is Rule User, focus is on comprehension transformation (Q2 - transforming RU).

**Governance cares about comprehension, not just delivery.** Sending message that nobody understands accomplishes nothing. Transforming RU from not-understanding to understanding enables compliance.

**Core communication atom:**

**Rule Maker, retrieves, decision/rule, (from official record)** [Q3]
- Peripheral - getting content to communicate

**Rule Maker, creates, educational materials, (explaining rule)** [Q2]
- Peripheral - preparing materials for communication

**Rule Maker, distributes, materials, to Rule Users** [Q3]
- Peripheral - delivering materials

**Rule Maker, converts, Rule User, to comprehending state** [Q2]
- THIS is core communication
- Object: Rule User
- Transformation: Not understanding → Understanding
- Q2 because transforming without moving (RU's location unchanged, mental state changes)

**Observable characteristics:**
- RU can explain rule (comprehension test)
- RU can answer questions correctly (comprehension verification)
- Training completion records (informational trace)
- Assessment scores (comprehension measurement)

**Evidence:**
Comprehension verification results are evidence communication occurred successfully.

### 5.9 Enforcement Activities: Transforming Rule User Status

**Core essence: Converting Rule User from non-compliant to sanctioned.**

Enforcement is fundamentally transformation of Rule User's status/privileges/access.

**Parallel to communication:**

Communication transforms RU: Not understanding → Understanding
Enforcement transforms RU: Non-compliant no-consequence → Non-compliant sanctioned

Both have Rule User as object being transformed.

**Core enforcement atoms:**

**Rule Maker, detects, violation, (creating record)** [Q2]
- Transformation: Observation → Formal violation record
- Q2 because creating record

**Rule Maker, determines, appropriate consequence, (per policy)** [Q2]
- Transformation: Violation + policy → Consequence determination
- Q2 because creating determination

**Rule Maker, creates, enforcement record, (documenting action)** [Q2]
- Transformation: Nothing → Enforcement record
- Q2 because creating record

**Rule Maker, converts, Rule User status, (applying consequence)** [Q2]
- THIS is core enforcement
- Object: Rule User
- Transformation: Normal status → Sanctioned status
- May include: Access revoked, privileges suspended, penalties applied
- Q2 because transforming without moving (RU's status changes, possibly location if removed)

**Observable characteristics:**
- Violation record exists (informational)
- Consequence applied (RU status changed)
- Enforcement record documents action (informational)
- Timestamps show when enforcement occurred (temporal)

**Evidence:**
Violation records, enforcement records, status change logs are evidence enforcement occurred.

### 5.10 Core vs Peripheral Administrative Activities

Not all administrative activities are equally essential to governance functioning.

**Core activities define governance essence:**

These activities MUST occur for governance to exist:
- Monitoring: Creating records (Q2)
- Analysis: Creating analysis (Q2)
- Reporting: Converting analysis + Sending to DM (Q2 + Q3)
- Decision: DM deciding (Q2)
- Documentation: Creating decision record (Q2, which is monitoring)
- Announcement: Moving to RUs (Q3)
- Communication: Converting RU comprehension (Q2)
- Enforcement: Converting RU status (Q2)

**Peripheral activities enable core but aren't essence:**

These activities support core but governance essence doesn't depend on them:
- Observing (before recording) - enables monitoring
- Retrieving (getting information) - enables analysis
- Reviewing (reading/considering) - enables decision
- Storing (maintaining records) - enables retrieval
- Notifying (informing about actions) - supplements announcement
- Distributing (disseminating materials) - supplements communication
- Detecting (identifying violations) - enables enforcement

**Specification priority:**

Always specify core activities (these define whether governance exists).
Specify peripheral activities when important for context, leave implicit when obvious.

### 5.11 Self-Referential Nature as Completeness Proof

**Administrative activities are activities** with Actor-Action-Object-Target structure, observable characteristics, quadrant classification - same as all other activities.

This is not additional complexity. This is proof of architectural completeness.

**If governance activities required different structure than governed activities**, model would be incomplete - would need special cases for governance.

**But governance activities fit same structure perfectly:**
- "Rule Maker, creates, monitoring record" - Actor-Action-Object
- "Decision Maker, approves, proposal" - Actor-Action-Object
- "Rule Maker, converts, Rule User comprehension" - Actor-Action-Object

**This proves universality:** Same model applies to ALL activities, no exceptions.

**Self-referential application enables accountability:**
- Rule Users can verify Rule Makers monitored (check for monitoring records)
- Rule Makers can verify Decision Makers decided (check for decision records)
- Decision Makers can verify Rule Makers analyzed (check for analysis documents)

All using same activity verification model.

**This is how governance governs itself** - using same atomic structure, same observable characteristics, same evidence requirements, same enforcement mechanisms.

No special privileges for governors. Same accountability model throughout.

## 6. Observable Characteristics: Why Visibility Matters

### 6.1 Can't Govern What You Can't See

This principle is foundational and non-negotiable.

**If an activity is not observable, it is not governable.**

Why:
- Cannot monitor what you cannot observe
- Cannot collect evidence about what leaves no traces
- Cannot verify compliance if cannot detect occurrence or non-occurrence
- Cannot enforce requirements on activities you cannot see

**Observable means:**

Someone or something can detect the activity occurring or not occurring:
- Through direct observation (watching it happen)
- Through traces it leaves (logs, records, artifacts)
- Through state changes it causes (before/after comparison)

**Unobservable abstractions cannot be governed:**

"Act responsibly" - how do you observe responsibility?
"Maintain vigilance" - how do you observe vigilance?
"Ensure quality" - how do you observe "ensuring"?

These are aspirations, not governable activities. No amount of good intentions makes them observable.

**Observable specifications can be governed:**

"Employee, encrypts, file, before transmission" - can verify encryption occurred
"Rule Maker, creates, monitoring record, weekly" - can verify records exist with weekly timestamps
"Decision Maker, approves, proposal, in writing" - can verify written approval exists

**Atomic visibility requirement:**

Must be able to observe at atomic level (Actor-Action-Object-Target specified).

If specification is compound but atoms hidden (blackboxed), cannot verify which atom succeeded/failed when problem occurs.

**Visibility is not just nice-to-have. Visibility is existential requirement for governance.**

### 6.2 Observable Characteristics Enable Verification

Observable characteristics are properties of activities that enable detection and verification.

**What makes activities observable:**

Activities become observable because they have characteristics that:
- Change something detectable (state, location, information)
- Leave traces (logs, records, artifacts, physical evidence)
- Involve observable entities (physical objects, measurable properties, documented information)
- Occur at detectable times (timestamps, durations, sequences)
- Involve identifiable actors (attribution possible)

**Different activities have different observable characteristics:**

Physical activities → Observable through physical changes (location, materials, tools)
Informational activities → Observable through data changes (logs, access records, communications)
Status activities → Observable through state changes (permissions, privileges, classifications)
Comprehension activities → Observable through demonstration (tests, explanations, applications)

**Observable characteristics serve different purposes:**

**For monitoring:** What to watch for (detect when activity occurs)
**For evidence:** What traces to collect (prove activity occurred)
**For verification:** What to check (determine compliance)
**For attribution:** What shows who (identify actor)

**Specification includes observable characteristics:**

When specifying activity atomically (Actor-Action-Object-Target), must also specify what makes it observable.

Not just: "Employee encrypts file"
But: "Employee encrypts file (encryption verified through file properties, action logged with employee ID and timestamp, encrypted file accessible through normal means)"

Observable characteristics make atomic specification complete and governable.

### 6.3 Examples of Observable Characteristics

Observable characteristics vary by activity type and context. Here are examples across different categories:

**Physical observable characteristics:**

"Employee, enters, restricted area, (through controlled door)"
- Location: Entry through specific door (physical)
- Tools: Badge reader records entry (physical device)
- Timing: Timestamp of entry (temporal)
- Actor identification: Badge ID shows who entered (attribution)

"Worker, operates, machinery, (with safety equipment)"
- Materials: Safety equipment visible/worn (physical)
- Tools: Machinery operation logged (informational)
- Location: Work area (physical)
- Participants: Worker present (physical)

**Informational observable characteristics:**

"Employee, accesses, database, (from device ID-123)"
- Logs: Database access log entry (informational)
- Data touched: Specific records accessed (informational)
- Timing: Access timestamp (temporal)
- Actor identification: User ID + device ID (attribution)
- Location: IP address or physical location (spatial/informational)

"Rule Maker, creates, monitoring record, (about user activity)"
- Documentation: Monitoring record exists (informational)
- Content: Record describes observed activity (informational)
- Timing: Record creation timestamp (temporal)
- Actor identification: RM ID who created record (attribution)

**Temporal observable characteristics:**

"System, backs up, data, (daily at 2 AM)"
- Timing: Backup occurs at 2 AM (temporal schedule)
- Frequency: Daily (temporal pattern)
- Duration: Backup completion time (temporal)
- Sequence: Backup before other processes (temporal ordering)

"Employee, submits, report, (by end of month)"
- Deadline: End of month (temporal constraint)
- Timing: Actual submission timestamp (temporal)
- Sequence: After data collection, before review (temporal ordering)

**Relational observable characteristics:**

"Manager, approves, expense, (for employee)"
- Interaction: Manager-employee relationship (relational)
- Direction: Approval flows from manager to employee (relational)
- Documentation: Approval record links actors (relational)

"Rule Maker, sends, submission, to Decision Maker"
- Interaction: RM-DM relationship (relational)
- Direction: Information flow from RM to DM (relational)
- Delivery confirmation: DM receipt (relational)

**The variety shows:**

Observable characteristics are not single taxonomy - they vary by activity type, context, governance needs.

What matters is identifying what makes EACH activity observable in ITS context, not fitting every activity into predetermined categories.

### 6.4 Observable Characteristics Vary by Activity

Different activities require different observable characteristics for governance.

**Example: Monitoring user data access**

Observable characteristics needed:
- Who accessed (user ID from authentication)
- What accessed (record ID from database query)
- When accessed (timestamp from log)
- From where (device ID, IP address, physical location)
- What done (read, modify, delete from query type)

**Example: Decision Maker approving policy**

Observable characteristics needed:
- Who decided (Decision Maker identity)
- What decided on (proposal ID)
- When decided (decision timestamp)
- What outcome (approve/reject/defer)
- Documentation (written record of decision)

**Example: Communication transforming Rule User comprehension**

Observable characteristics needed:
- Who communicated (Rule Maker identity)
- To whom (Rule User identity)
- About what (rule content)
- When (training timestamp)
- Comprehension verification (test score, demonstration, explanation)

**Example: Physical access to restricted area**

Observable characteristics needed:
- Who entered (badge ID)
- Where entered (door ID)
- When entered (timestamp)
- Authorization (badge permission verified)
- Duration (time in area)

**The pattern:**

Governance needs determine which observable characteristics matter.

Don't specify all possible characteristics - specify characteristics needed for governance purpose (monitoring, evidence, verification, enforcement).

**Context matters:**

Same activity in different contexts may need different observable characteristics:

Family context: "Child, completes, homework" - Parent observes directly, homework physically present
Corporate context: "Employee, completes, training" - System logs completion, assessment score recorded, certificate generated
Government context: "Citizen, files, tax return" - Formal submission record, receipt confirmation, digital signature

Same fundamental activity, different observable characteristics based on governance context and evidence standards.

**This flexibility is strength, not weakness** - model adapts to context while maintaining atomic structure.

## 7. Composition: Atoms Compose While Remaining Visible

### 7.1 Activities Compose Hierarchically

Activities naturally compose - simple atoms combine to form more complex compounds.

Like molecules compose from atoms:
- Atoms are fundamental units
- Molecules combine atoms
- But atoms remain identifiable within molecules
- Can break molecule down to atoms when needed

Similarly:
- Activity atoms are fundamental units
- Compound activities combine atoms
- But atoms remain identifiable within compounds
- Can decompose compound to atoms when needed for governance

**Governance operates on atoms, not compounds.**

Compounds are useful for human understanding (mental models of complex processes), but governance specification, monitoring, and enforcement operate at atomic level.

**Why atoms must remain visible:**

If atoms hidden inside blackbox compounds:
- Cannot observe specific atoms occurring
- Cannot verify which atom succeeded/failed
- Cannot attribute responsibility precisely
- Cannot enforce requirements on specific atoms

**Atomic visibility is non-negotiable** even when activities compose into compounds.

### 7.2 Refinement vs Decomposition

Activities can become more specific through two different mechanisms:

**Refinement (Adding Qualifiers):**

Starting activity: "Access data"
Add qualifier: "Access data remotely"
Add qualifier: "Access data remotely from unmanaged device"

Each step adds specification detail without changing fundamental action. Still one activity, increasingly qualified.

**Decomposition (Breaking Into Parts):**

Starting compound: "Complete training"
Decompose: "Attend session" + "Complete assessment" + "Sign acknowledgment"

This breaks compound into constituent atomic parts. Three separate activities, each with own observable characteristics.

**When refinement matters:**

Different qualifiers trigger different governance requirements:
- "Access from managed device" (lower security requirements)
- "Access from unmanaged device" (higher security requirements)

Refinement enables precise scope definition without decomposition.

**When decomposition matters:**

Sub-activities have different:
- Observable characteristics (attend = physical presence, assessment = digital completion)
- Actors (trainer conducts session, worker completes assessment)
- Evidence requirements (attendance log vs assessment score)
- Enforcement approaches (can fail assessment even if attended)

Decomposition enables governance of constituent parts independently.

**Both serve governance precision:**

Refinement: More specific about single activity
Decomposition: Breaking into multiple activities

Choose based on governance need.

### 7.3 Atoms Must Remain Visible

Even when activities compose into compounds, **atoms must remain visible and accessible.**

**Bad composition (Blackbox):**

"Ensure data security" = [hidden activities]
- Cannot see what atoms constitute "ensuring"
- Cannot verify which atoms occurred
- Cannot enforce requirements on invisible atoms

**Good composition (Transparent):**

"Secure data transmission" = 
- "Employee, encrypts, file, before transmission" [atom, observable]
- "Employee, transmits, encrypted file, via approved channel" [atom, observable]
- "Employee, verifies, transmission completion, through confirmation" [atom, observable]

Compound named for understanding, but atoms remain visible and specified.

**When compounds are useful:**

For human communication: "Complete the secure transmission process" is easier than listing three atoms.

For documentation: Compound names help organize related atoms.

For understanding: Seeing how atoms relate helps comprehension.

**When atoms are essential:**

For monitoring: Must observe specific atoms occurring.

For evidence: Must collect traces from specific atoms.

For enforcement: Must verify specific atomic requirements met.

For accountability: Must attribute specific atoms to actors.

**Governance always decomposes to atoms when verifying, even if compounds used for communication.**

### 7.4 Governance Operates on Atoms

This is fundamental principle:

**Governance specifications, monitoring, evidence, enforcement all operate at atomic level.**

**Not:** "Employees must ensure data security"
**But:** "Employee, encrypts, customer file, before transmission" + "Employee, transmits, file, through VPN" (specific atoms)

**Not:** "Rule Makers must maintain oversight"
**But:** "Rule Maker, creates, monitoring record, weekly" + "Rule Maker, reviews, monitoring data, monthly" (specific atoms)

**Not:** "Management must exercise due diligence"
**But:** "Manager, reviews, employee report, weekly" + "Manager, approves, decisions, in writing" (specific atoms)

**Why governance must operate on atoms:**

**Monitoring:** Can only observe specific atomic activities, not vague compounds.

**Evidence:** Can only collect traces from specific atoms, not abstractions.

**Verification:** Can only check if specific atomic requirements met, not vague aspirations.

**Enforcement:** Can only enforce compliance with specific atomic obligations, not general principles.

**Accountability:** Can only attribute specific atoms to actors, not compound abstractions.

**This is why Activity Specification Model is foundational** - it establishes atomic level as governance reality, enabling all other frameworks to operate on clear, observable, verifiable foundation.

**Compounds serve humans. Atoms serve governance.**

Both can coexist - compounds for communication, atoms for specification/verification/enforcement.

---

## 8. Integration: Activities Unify All Frameworks

### 8.1 Activities as Unifying Layer

Every OMGS framework references activities, but until now, activities were undefined.

**Legitimacy Framework** talks about "rule administration activities" expressing legitimacy.
**Accountability Framework** talks about rights and obligations as activities.
**Role Framework** assigns activities to roles.
**Lifecycle Framework** sequences activities through stages.
**Content Standard** requires activity-centered design.

**All reference activities. None defined activities.**

This created appearance of separate frameworks - each seemed to operate independently, connections seemed arbitrary.

**Activity Specification Model reveals the unifying layer:**

All frameworks connect through activities. Connections are not arbitrary - they are necessary consequences of activities being fundamental reality.

**With activities explicitly defined:**
- Legitimacy expresses through activities (soul → body → movement)
- Accountability verifies activities (rights/obligations as activities)
- Roles assign activities (who does which atoms)
- Lifecycle sequences activities (common patterns)
- Content specifies activities (requirements on atoms)

**Activities are THE foundation all frameworks build on.**

Without activities defined, frameworks seem complicated.
With activities defined, frameworks are coherent.

### 8.2 Connection to Legitimacy Framework

**Legitimacy is soul, activities are movement.**

Section 1.3 of Legitimacy Framework establishes:
- Legitimacy is soul of governance
- OMGS is skeleton structuring governance
- Body is entire institution system
- Movement is rule administration activities
- Outcomes reveal health

**Activities are how legitimacy expresses in observable reality.**

Legitimacy (invisible, abstract) → Activities (visible, concrete) → Outcomes (observable consequences)

**Soul without movement is dead:**
- Legitimacy that doesn't express through activities is non-existent
- Must see legitimate governance operating through observable activities
- If activities don't occur or occur improperly, legitimacy not functioning

**Symptoms of legitimacy erosion are activity patterns:**

**Loss of Multi-Visibility:**
- Observable through: Consultation activities becoming formalities, information-sharing activities declining, coordination activities failing
- Activities reveal the loss

**Loss of Wisdom Transmission:**
- Observable through: Newer members rejecting older members' guidance activities, institutional documentation activities declining, lessons-learned activities not occurring
- Activities reveal the loss

**Loss of Net Positive Exchange:**
- Observable through: Contribution activities (paying taxes, complying with rules) declining, free-riding activities increasing, exit activities increasing
- Activities reveal the loss

**Loss of Complex Organization:**
- Observable through: Coordination activities failing, specialized-role activities resisted, long-term project activities abandoned
- Activities reveal the loss

**Activities make legitimacy's invisible health visible through observable patterns.**

### 8.3 Connection to Accountability Framework

**Rights and obligations specify activities.**

Accountability Framework establishes rights and obligations as mechanism connecting legitimacy to operations. But rights and obligations abstract until connected to activities.

**Obligations specify activities that must be performed:**

"Rule Maker has obligation to monitor user activities"
→ Translates to: "Rule Maker must perform monitoring activities: observe user activities, create monitoring records, store records"
→ Atomic specification: "Rule Maker, creates, monitoring record, weekly" (specific atomic obligation)

"Rule User has obligation to comply with requirements"
→ Translates to: "Rule User must perform rule activities as specified"
→ Atomic specification: "Employee, encrypts, customer file, before transmission" (specific atomic requirement)

**Rights specify activities that can be performed to verify obligations:**

"Rule User has right to challenge enforcement"
→ Translates to: "Rule User can perform challenge activity: submit challenge, receive response"
→ Atomic specification: "Rule User, submits, challenge, to Rule Maker" + "Rule Maker, responds, to challenge, within deadline"

"Rule Maker has right to get information from Decision Maker"
→ Translates to: "Rule Maker can perform information-request activity"
→ Atomic specification: "Rule Maker, requests, decision rationale, from Decision Maker" + "Decision Maker, provides, rationale, to Rule Maker"

**When enacted, rights/obligations manifest as observable activities:**

Abstract: "RM has obligation to provide safety training to RU"
Concrete: "RM, provides, training materials, to RU" + "RM, conducts, training session, with RU" + "RU, completes, assessment, demonstrating comprehension"

**Evidence of obligation fulfillment is activity traces:**

To verify RM fulfilled training obligation:
- Check for training materials provided (activity trace)
- Check for training session occurred (activity trace)
- Check for assessment completed (activity trace)

All evidence comes from observable activities and their traces.

**Activities make accountability mechanism operational** - transforming abstract rights/obligations into concrete, observable, verifiable activities.

### 8.4 Connection to Role Framework

**Roles assign activities to actors.**

Role Framework establishes three roles: Rule User, Rule Maker, Decision Maker. But roles abstract until connected to activities.

**Role User performs:**
- User activities (all activities Rule Users naturally do)
- Rule activities (subset being governed)
- Verification activities (exercising rights to check governance)

**Rule Maker performs:**
- Monitoring activities (observing, recording)
- Analysis activities (evaluating evidence)
- Reporting activities (submitting to DM)
- Communication activities (explaining to RUs)
- Enforcement activities (applying consequences)

**Decision Maker performs:**
- Decision activities (choosing outcomes)
- Oversight activities (checking RM work)

**Inter-oversight operates through activity verification:**

Rule Users verify Rule Makers performed required activities:
- Check for monitoring records (evidence of monitoring activities)
- Check for communication materials (evidence of communication activities)
- Check for enforcement actions (evidence of enforcement activities)

Rule Makers verify Decision Makers performed required activities:
- Check for decision records (evidence of decision activities)
- Check for decision rationales (evidence of deliberation activities)

Decision Makers verify Rule Makers performed required activities:
- Check for analysis documents (evidence of analysis activities)
- Check for monitoring records (evidence of monitoring activities)

**All verification is checking for activity evidence.**

**Roles become concrete through activities** - each role defined by which activities it performs and which activities it can verify.

### 8.5 Connection to Lifecycle Framework

**Lifecycle stages are activity pattern names.**

Lifecycle Framework describes six stages: Monitoring, Analysis, Decision, Announcement, Communication, Enforcement. These are not abstract process phases - they are names for common administrative activity patterns.

**Monitoring stage = Monitoring activity pattern:**
- "Rule Maker, observes, user activities"
- "Rule Maker, creates, monitoring records"
- "Rule Maker, stores, records"

Pattern named "Monitoring" for convenience, but actual reality is these specific atomic activities.

**Analysis stage = Analysis activity pattern:**
- "Rule Maker, retrieves, monitoring records"
- "Rule Maker, creates, analysis"

Pattern named "Analysis" but actual reality is these atoms.

**Each stage decomposes to specific activity atoms** as detailed in Section 5.

**Episodic events trigger activity clusters:**

Lifecycle describes episodic events (specific occurrences triggering governance response). Events are detectable because they manifest as activities:

Environment change event = Specific environment activities occurring that differ from baseline
- Detected through: Monitoring activities observing environment activities

Violation event = Specific rule activity occurring that violates requirements
- Detected through: Monitoring activities observing rule activities

**Stages interleave, don't sequence:**

Section 5.1 breaks sequential illusion - stages aren't pipeline, they're concurrent activity patterns.

Monitoring activities occur continuously.
Analysis activities occur episodically.
Decision activities occur when triggered.
Communication activities occur ongoing.

**Activities reveal the reality behind lifecycle abstraction** - not sequential stages but concurrent, interleaved atomic activities following common patterns.

### 8.6 Connection to Content Standard

**Content Standard requires activity-centered design.**

Rule Content Standard (Doc 13) establishes three-part structure: Content, Administration, Justification. Each part connects to activities.

**Content Part (What's Governed):**

Section 4.2.1: Scope must specify governed activities
- "Employees accessing customer data from unmanaged devices" (specific rule activities)
- Not: "Data security" (abstract, unclear what activities)

Section 4.2.2: Requirements must specify activities with observable characteristics
- "Must encrypt file before transmission" (specific activity with observable encryption)
- Not: "Must handle data responsibly" (no observable activity)

**Administration Part (How Governance Operates):**

Section 4.2.5: Administration specification requires operational planning
- "Rule Maker monitors access logs weekly" (monitoring activities specified)
- "Rule Maker analyzes patterns monthly" (analysis activities specified)

**These are administrative activities** detailed in Section 5 of this document.

**Justification Part (Why Requirements Exist):**

Section 4.3.1: Outcomes must be specified
- Outcomes result from activities (or their absence)
- "Unencrypted transmission results in data breach" (consequence of activity not occurring)

**Activity-centered design means:**

Rules specify:
- Which user activities become rule activities (scope)
- What requirements apply to those activities (content)
- What administrative activities govern them (administration)
- What outcomes activities produce (justification)

**Activities make rules operational** - transforming vague aspirations into concrete, observable, enforceable specifications.

### 8.7 Why Activities Are THE Foundation

**Without activities explicitly defined:**

Legitimacy Framework talks about legitimacy expressing through "rule administration activities" but unclear what activities are.

Accountability Framework talks about rights/obligations but unclear how they manifest operationally.

Role Framework assigns responsibilities but unclear what specific actions roles perform.

Lifecycle Framework describes stages but unclear what actually happens in stages.

Content Standard requires activity-centered design but unclear what activities are or how to specify them.

**Each framework references activities but none define them.**

Result: Frameworks seem separate, connections seem arbitrary, implementation unclear.

**With activities explicitly defined:**

Legitimacy expresses through activities (Section 8.2).
Accountability verifies activities (Section 8.3).
Roles assign activities (Section 8.4).
Lifecycle sequences activities (Section 8.5).
Content specifies activities (Section 8.6).

**Connections are necessary, not arbitrary.** All frameworks operate on same foundation: observable atomic activities.

**Activities are THE unifying layer** - the fundamental reality all frameworks reference, build upon, and operationalize through.

**This is why Activity Specification Model is keystone document** - it completes the foundation, enabling all other frameworks to connect coherently through activities.

**OMGS architecture is now complete:**
```
LEGITIMACY (Soul - why governance exists)
    ↓ expresses through
ACTIVITIES (Atomic reality - what actually happens)
    ↓ verified by
ACCOUNTABILITY (Mechanism - how to check)
    ↓ assigned by
ROLES (Structure - who does which activities)
    ↓ sequenced by
LIFECYCLE (Process - how activities flow)
    ↓ specified by
CONTENT (Requirements - what activities must achieve)
```

Everything connects through activities. Remove activities, architecture collapses. Define activities, architecture stands complete.
