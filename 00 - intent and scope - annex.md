# Open Meta-Governance Standard – Doc 0 Annex A  
**Relation to Existing Work and Distinctive Features (DRAFT)**

> *This annex summarises how OMGS relates to existing governance and policy thinking, and what is distinctive about its approach. It is background material and not required to apply the kernel.*

---

## A.1 Meta-governance and meta-regulation

- Meta-governance and meta-regulation literature often define “rules of rules” or “governance of governance”.  
- They typically describe:
  - how the state steers networks and markets,  
  - how regulators oversee firms’ internal rule systems,  
  - broad principles for reflexive regulation.

**OMGS alignment:**

- OMGS shares the concern with **rules that govern rules** and with reflexive, adaptive governance.

**OMGS distinctives:**

- OMGS provides:
  - a **concrete ontology** (Doc 1) of actors, environments, and activities;  
  - a domain-agnostic **lifecycle kernel** (Doc 2) with explicit stages and flows.  
- It is meant to be:
  - **implementable** (processes, roles, tools),  
  - **auditable**, and  
  - **portable** across sectors.

## A.2 Policy and regulatory lifecycle models

- Many guides and manuals show a **policy/regulation cycle**, e.g.:
  - problem identification,  
  - analysis and options,  
  - decision/adoption,  
  - implementation,  
  - monitoring and evaluation,  
  - review/termination.

**OMGS alignment:**

- The OMGS cycles are deliberately compatible:
  - Environment change + monitoring ≈ problem identification;  
  - Analysis ≈ options and impact assessment;  
  - Reporting ≈ proposal / regulatory impact statement;  
  - Decision ≈ adoption;  
  - Announcement + communication ≈ implementation / communication;  
  - Enforcement + monitoring ≈ compliance and evaluation.

**OMGS distinctives:**

- Explicit **two-cycle structure**:
  - proposal cycle vs implementation cycle.  
- Explicit linkage to **environment activities and external activities** at each stage.  
- Clear separation between:
  - **announcement** (formal notice) and  
  - **communication** (actual comprehension and guidance).

## A.3 Institutional analysis and rule-focused frameworks

- Institutional analysis frameworks model how rules, actors, and incentives shape outcomes in an “action arena”.  
- They often classify different types of rules and study how rules-in-use operate.

**OMGS alignment:**

- OMGS uses a similarly precise approach to distinguishing:
  - actors,  
  - rules,  
  - resources,  
  - activities,  
  - environment.

**OMGS distinctives:**

- OMGS is **normative and procedural**, not just analytical:
  - It does not only help describe an existing system;  
  - it specifies how a rule system **should** manage rule change over time, via defined stages.

---

## A.4 Legal and regulatory ontologies, and rule languages

- Various legal/governance ontologies and rule representations exist to express:
  - obligations, permissions, prohibitions, roles, and processes,  
  - in ways that tools and machines can reason about.

**OMGS alignment:**

- OMGS assumes rules can be represented in such languages.  
- The “rule content” concept is compatible with structured, even machine-readable, forms.

**OMGS distinctives:**

- OMGS focuses on **lifecycle and environment linkage**:
  - it standardises *how rules are proposed, adopted, communicated, enforced, and revised*;  
  - it anchors each stage in observable **activities** in the rule environment and in external activities.  
- It is intended to be a **kernel beneath multiple representation schemes**.

## A.5 Summary of distinctive OMGS features

For quick reference, the main distinctive features of OMGS are:

1. **Clear separation of spaces**  
   - Rule environment (rule users + rule resources) vs rule ecosystem (environment + rule makers + decision makers) vs external factors.

2. **Activity lattice**  
   - environment activities → user activities → rule activities as nested sets;  
   - administrative activities as everything rule makers/decision makers do around rules;  
   - enforcement activities as the subset of administrative activities directly targeting rule users.

3. **Two-cycle lifecycle**  
   - Proposal: environment change → monitoring → analysis → reporting;  
   - Implementation: decision → announcement → communication → enforcement.

4. **Environment-anchored stages**  
   - Each stage is explicitly defined in terms of environment activities and external activities.

5. **Rule content as structured, with lifecycle hooks**  
   - Rule content always includes scope, targeted activities, intended outcomes, enforcement, and lifecycle rules (including review triggers).

6. **Continuous monitoring and analysis**  
   - Monitoring and analysis are defined as ongoing functions, not occasional evaluations.

7. **Portable, domain-agnostic kernel**  
   - Designed to underlay multiple sectoral frameworks and technical implementations.
