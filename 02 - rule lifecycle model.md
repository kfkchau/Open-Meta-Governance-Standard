# Open Meta-Governance Standard – Doc 2  
**Rule Lifecycle Model (DRAFT)**

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the **rule lifecycle model** for the Open Meta-Governance Standard.

It explains:

- how changes in what is happening in the **rule environment** and through **external activities** are turned into proposals to change rules;  
- how decisions about rules are turned into real changes in **rule activities** carried out by **rule users**;  
- how the different stages of the lifecycle relate to the actors, artefacts, and activities defined in the **Concepts and Ontology** document.

This document is about **what happens to rules over time**. It assumes all concepts from Document 1 - Concepts and Ontology (rule user, rule resource, rule maker, decision maker, rule environment, rule ecosystem, activities, rule, rule submission, rule content).

It does **not** yet prescribe formal “requirements language” (“must”, “shall”) – that belongs in later, normative documents. Here the goal is conceptual clarity and complete coverage.

---

## 2. Relationship to the Concepts and Ontology

The **Concepts and Ontology** document defines:

- the **actors**: rule users, rule makers, decision makers, external factors;  
- the **rule artefacts**: rules, rule submissions, rule content;  
- the **spaces**: rule environment, rule ecosystem;  
- the **activities**: environment activities, user activities, rule activities, external activities, enforcement activities, administrative activities.

This **Lifecycle Model** document does not introduce new entities. Instead, it specifies:

- how rule makers and decision makers,  
- acting within the rule ecosystem,  
- move rules and rule submissions through a sequence of stages,  
- by acting on environment activities, user activities, rule activities, and external activities.

In short:

> Doc 1: “What exists.”  
> Doc 2: “What happens to rules, using those things.”

## 3. Overview – Two Coupled Cycles

From first principles, governing rules involves two distinct but connected flows:

1. **Proposing changes to rules**  
   - noticing that the world in which rules operate has changed,  
   - understanding what that change means for rules,  
   - designing candidate rule responses, and  
   - turning them into rule submissions.

2. **Implementing approved changes to rules**  
   - deciding which rule submissions become rules,  
   - telling rule users what has changed,  
   - helping rule users understand and act accordingly, and  
   - aligning rule activities with rule content through enforcement.

These are expressed as two coupled cycles in the rule ecosystem.

### 3.1 Rule change proposal cycle

The **rule change proposal cycle** converts changes in the world into structured proposals to change rules.

Stages:

1. **Environment change** (as observed in environment activities and external activities)  
2. **Monitoring** (ongoing observation)  
3. **Analysis** (evidence-based understanding and design)  
4. **Reporting** (formulating rule submissions)

### 3.2 Rule implementation cycle

The **rule implementation cycle** converts decisions on rules into changes in actual behaviour inside the rule environment.

Stages:

5. **Decision** (approving, modifying, or rejecting rule submissions)  
6. **Announcement** (formal notification of rules and changes)  
7. **Communication** (translation into understandable guidance for rule users)  
8. **Enforcement** (aligning rule activities with rule content)

The two cycles are linked: the outputs of implementation (especially enforcement and observed user activities) feed back into monitoring and analysis.

---

## 4. Rule Change Proposal Cycle

The rule change proposal cycle describes how **environment activities** and **external activities** that have changed are detected, understood, and turned into **rule submissions**.

### 4.1 Environment change (condition, not action)

**Definition**

Environment change is a condition in the rule ecosystem where:

- the pattern of **environment activities** (interactions between rule users and rule resources), and/or  
- the pattern of **external activities** (interactions between external factors and the rule environment)

has become **meaningfully different** from the assumptions and expectations under which one or more rules were designed, adopted, or last reviewed.

**Key points**

- Environment change is **not** a stage where anyone does anything; it is a description of reality.  
- It may be gradual (drift) or sudden (shock).  
- It may be visible in data, incidents, complaints, market signals, technology, or other forms of evidence.

If environment change is not recognised and processed through the subsequent stages, the rule system will drift out of alignment with the rule environment.

---

### 4.2 Monitoring – ongoing observation of environment and external activities

**Definition**

Monitoring is an **ongoing administrative activity** performed by rule makers, in which they:

- observe and collect information about:
  - environment activities (what rule users and rule resources are actually doing and how they interact), and  
  - external activities (how external factors are interacting with rule users and rule resources);  
- compare these observations to:
  - the assumptions encoded in rule content, and  
  - the outcomes that rules are intended to produce.

Monitoring exists so that environment change does not remain invisible.

**Actors involved**

- Rule makers are directly responsible.  
- Rule users and rule resources are the subjects of many observed activities.  
- External factors act through external activities.

**Activities and artefacts**

Monitoring operates on:

- environment activities;  
- external activities;  
- existing rule content (assumptions, scope, targeted rule activities, intended outcomes).

Monitoring produces:

- observations, indicators, and summaries of environment activities and external activities;  
- early signals that environment change may have occurred;  
- material for analysis (data, reports, event logs).

**Why this stage exists**

Without monitoring:

- environment change is only discovered after large failures or scandals;  
- rule changes become reactive and crisis-driven;  
- rule content is not regularly checked against what users and resources actually do.

Monitoring is ideally continuous or at least regular, not something that only starts when a problem is already obvious.

---

### 4.3 Analysis – evidence-based understanding and design of candidate rule activities

**Definition**

Analysis is an administrative activity where rule makers take the outputs of monitoring and:

1. **Understand what has changed**, based on evidence:
   - in environment activities: how rule users and rule resources are behaving or interacting differently;  
   - in external activities: how external factors are acting differently on the rule environment.

2. **Understand what problem or risk exists, if any**, in relation to rules:
   - how these changes affect current rules and their rule activities (do they still achieve their intended outcomes? are they too weak, too strong, misdirected, or irrelevant?);  
   - whether there are important environment activities and user activities causing harm or risk that are not covered by any rules.

3. **Identify which user activities should become rule activities**:
   - selecting specific user activities as good candidates for governance because they are leverage points to change outcomes in the rule environment.

4. **Design candidate rules** to manage those rule activities:
   - sketching or drafting rule content that:
     - defines which rule users and rule resources would be in scope;  
     - specifies which user activities would become rule activities;  
     - sets the intended outcomes (what should be different in the environment);  
     - outlines an appropriate enforcement approach;  
     - identifies review triggers based on observed environment activities and external activities.

Analysis is **evidence-based** and **design-oriented**: it uses observed activities and external factors to design where and how rules should act.

**Actors involved**

- Rule makers lead and perform analysis.  
- Rule users and rule resources are the subjects of the activities being analysed.  
- External factors are part of the changing context being examined.

**Activities and artefacts**

Analysis operates on:

- monitored environment activities;  
- monitored external activities;  
- existing rule content;  
- any associated evidence gathered by rule makers.

Analysis produces:

- structured understanding of environment change;  
- identification of affected rule activities and gaps (activities with no rules);  
- proposals for which user activities should be governed;  
- drafts or outlines of candidate rule content.

**Why this stage exists**

Without analysis:

- decisions to change rules are based on anecdotes or pressure, not structured understanding;  
- rules are added or changed without clear links to specific user activities and environment activities;  
- the system accumulates rules that do not effectively target the actual leverage points in the environment.

---

### 4.4 Reporting – turning analysis into rule submissions

**Definition**

Reporting is an administrative activity where rule makers convert the outputs of analysis into a **rule submission** that decision makers can legitimately act on.

Reporting involves:

- describing the observed changes in environment activities and external activities;  
- explaining the implications for existing rules or the absence of rules;  
- specifying which user activities are proposed to become rule activities;  
- proposing concrete rule content (or changes to rule content);  
- packaging this into a clear, structured rule submission.

**Actors involved**

- Rule makers prepare rule submissions.  
- Decision makers are the intended recipients and audience for these submissions.

**Activities and artefacts**

Reporting operates on:

- analytical outputs;  
- sketches of candidate rule content.

Reporting produces:

- one or more rule submissions that:
  - reference environment activities and external activities;  
  - propose changes to rule activities;  
  - contain a coherent block of rule content, including scope, targeted activities, intended outcomes, enforcement approach, and lifecycle rules.

**Why this stage exists**

Without reporting:

- decision makers are forced to act on fragmented or informal information;  
- rules are approved or rejected without a clear record of:
  - what problem they address,  
  - what activities they target,  
  - what outcomes they aim for;  
- the system cannot later reconstruct why a rule was introduced or changed.

Reporting is the bridge between analytical understanding and legitimate decision-making.

---

## 5. Rule Implementation Cycle

The rule implementation cycle describes how **decisions about rule submissions** become **rules**, and how those rules are then **made real** in the rule environment through rule user behaviour.

### 5.1 Decision – acting on rule submissions

**Definition**

Decision is the activity where decision makers exercise their authority over rule submissions. For each rule submission, decision makers:

- approve it (possibly with modifications), turning it into a rule; or  
- reject it; or  
- defer it pending further work.

Upon approval, the rule submission ceases to be a mere proposal and becomes a **rule** with rule content that is intended to bind or guide rule users and rule resources.

**Actors involved**

- Decision makers are central: they hold the authority.  
- Rule makers support and may advise but do not decide.

**Activities and artefacts**

Decision operates on:

- rule submissions;  
- any additional evidence or analysis that decision makers request.

Decision produces:

- rules (for approved submissions);  
- decision records (explaining what was decided and why);  
- sometimes instructions or conditions for further work by rule makers.

**Why this stage exists**

Without a clear decision stage:

- it is unclear when a rule submission becomes a rule;  
- informal practices may gain the force of rules without legitimate approval;  
- accountability for rule adoption is blurred (no one can say who decided and on what basis).

Decision is the **legitimacy gate** for rules inside the rule ecosystem.

---

### 5.2 Announcement – formal notification that a rule exists or has changed

**Definition**

Announcement is an administrative activity where rule makers (or authorised actors) formally notify rule users and other stakeholders that:

- a new rule has been adopted; or  
- an existing rule has been amended, suspended, or retired.

Announcement covers, at minimum:

- which rule is affected;  
- what its current status is;  
- when it comes into force or ceases to apply;  
- where more detailed information (rule content and communication) can be found.

**Actors involved**

- Rule makers (or designated communication or legal functions) perform announcements.  
- Rule users and other stakeholders are recipients.

**Activities and artefacts**

Announcement operates on:

- the outcome of decision (rules and decision records);  
- rule content.

Announcement produces:

- notices, bulletins, register entries, or equivalent artefacts that are:
  - accessible to relevant rule users, and  
  - treated as authoritative sources of rule status.

**Why this stage exists**

Without announcement:

- rules may exist “on paper” but rule users are not told they exist;  
- enforcement may be attempted against rule users who never had a formal chance to know about the rule;  
- there is no single place to check which rules are currently in force.

Announcement ensures there are **no “dark rules”** in the system.

---

### 5.3 Communication – making rule content understandable and actionable

**Definition**

Communication is an administrative activity where rule makers take rule content and translate it into:

- language, examples, and formats that rule users can understand;  
- guidance that connects rule content to concrete user activities;  
- explanations of how the rule affects rule users in their actual roles and tasks.

Communication aims to enable **willing compliance** by making clear:

- what the rule means in practice;  
- what rule activities are expected;  
- what actions are allowed, required, or prohibited.

**Actors involved**

- Rule makers (or specialised communication, training, or enablement functions) create and deliver communication.  
- Rule users are the audience; their comprehension is the measure of success.

**Activities and artefacts**

Communication operates on:

- rule content;  
- knowledge of rule users’ context and tasks;  
- sometimes feedback from rule users about what is confusing.

Communication produces:

- guidance documents, training materials, FAQs, examples;  
- tool-specific or process-specific instructions;  
- other materials that help rule users understand how rules map to user activities.

**Why this stage exists**

Without communication:

- rule users are expected to interpret raw rule content on their own;  
- misunderstandings are blamed on rule users rather than on poor explanation;  
- non-compliance may arise from confusion rather than intent.

Communication recognises that the responsibility for making rules understandable lies with the rule system, not with individual rule users.

---

### 5.4 Enforcement – aligning rule activities with rule content

**Definition**

Enforcement is the subset of administrative activities where rule makers act directly on rule users to increase alignment between:

- **rule activities** (the subset of user activities governed by rules), and  
- **the requirements described in rule content**.

Enforcement includes:

- checking and investigating user activities;  
- detecting cases where rule activities diverge from rule content;  
- responding through guidance, warnings, sanctions, remediation, or other measures;  
- requiring changes in user activities to restore or maintain alignment.

**Actors involved**

- Rule makers (or designated enforcement or compliance functions) carry out enforcement.  
- Rule users are the subjects of enforcement activities.

**Activities and artefacts**

Enforcement operates on:

- user activities and rule activities;  
- observations and evidence about those activities;  
- rule content (what is expected).

Enforcement produces:

- changes in user activities;  
- records of enforcement actions;  
- additional evidence about how rules are working in practice.

**Why this stage exists**

Without enforcement:

- rules become mere suggestions;  
- rule activities may drift far from rule content;  
- well-communicated rules may still be ignored, creating unfairness and risk for those who do comply.

At the same time, persistent enforcement problems (for example, widespread non-compliance despite clear communication and adequate resources) are an important **signal** that rule content, scope, or feasibility may be flawed.

---

## 6. Coupling between the cycles (simple view)

The two cycles are connected in two essential ways.

### 6.1 From reporting to decision

- The **output of reporting** is a rule submission.  
- The **input to decision** is that same rule submission.

In other words:

> Reporting → Decision

Reporting prepares the object; decision acts on it. There is no legitimate decision about a new rule or rule change without a rule submission.

### 6.2 From enforcement back to environment change and monitoring

- **Enforcement activities** change user activities (and therefore rule activities) inside the rule environment.  
- Those changes show up as **environment activities**.  
- Monitoring observes environment activities and external activities.

In other words:

> Enforcement → changed environment activities → Monitoring → (potentially) Analysis → Reporting

If enforcement reveals persistent non-compliance, confusion, or conflict between rules, that is itself a form of environment change that should eventually be seen in monitoring and then considered in analysis.

External activities can also feed directly into monitoring and analysis (for example, a new law or a major market shock), but the essential loop is:

- Proposal cycle produces rule submissions → Decision;  
- Implementation cycle produces changes in rule activities → new environment activities;  
- Monitoring watches those environment activities and external activities to see when proposals are needed again.

---

## 7. Summary

This lifecycle model defines:

- a **rule change proposal cycle** (environment change → monitoring → analysis → reporting), where rule makers turn changes in environment activities and external activities into rule submissions;  
- a **rule implementation cycle** (decision → announcement → communication → enforcement), where decision makers and rule makers turn rule submissions into rules and into changes in rule activities inside the rule environment.

Every stage is expressed only in terms of:

- the actors defined in the Concepts and Ontology (rule users, rule makers, decision makers, external factors);  
- the artefacts defined there (rules, rule submissions, rule content);  
- the activity types defined there (environment activities, user activities, rule activities, external activities, enforcement activities, administrative activities).

Later documents can now:

- attach **requirements** to each stage (what “good” looks like in enforceable terms);  
- define **processes and controls** that govern how the lifecycle is run;  
- and specify **profiles** for particular domains (such as AI governance, markets, social policy, or infrastructure).

This document’s role is to ensure that when we speak of “the rule lifecycle” in Open Meta-Governance, we are speaking about **this specific, well-defined structure**, and not about an unstated, ad hoc set of steps.
